		</div>

		<p>The writer has introduced this "Temporary
			Gentleman" to many good fellows in England,
			France, and Flanders, and is very anxious to introduce
			him on a really friendly footing to all his
			brothers-in-arms across the Atlantic; from New
			York to San Francisco, and from Quebec to Vancouver
			Island, also. But how best to do it? It
			really is no very easy matter, this, to present one
			simple, very human unit of the New Armies, to a
			hundred millions of people.</p>

		<p>"Dear America: Herewith please find one
			slightly damaged but wholly decent 'Temporary
			Gentleman' who you will find repays consideration."</p>

		<p>I think that is strictly true, and though, in a
			way, it covers the ground, it does not, somehow,
			seem wholly adequate; and I have an uncomfortable
			feeling that the critics might find in it ground
			for severe comments. But it is just what I mean;
			and I would be well content that all the kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
			men and women of America should just find out
			about this "Temporary Gentleman" for themselves,
			and form their own opinion, rather than
			that I should set down things about him in advance.
			If these letters of his do not commend
			him to America's heart and judgment, I am
			very sure no words of mine would stand any chance
			of doing so. Yes, for my part, warmly anxious
			as I am for America to know him, and to feel
			towards him as folk do in France and Flanders
			and Britain, I am perfectly prepared to let him
			stand or fall upon his own letters, which certainly
			discover the man to you, whatever you may
			think of him.</p>

		<p>Withal, in case it may interest any among the
			millions of American families from which some
			member has gone out to train and to fight, to
			save the Allied democracies of the world from
			being over-ridden by the murderous aggression
			of its remaining autocracies, I take pleasure in
			testifying here to the fact that among the officers
			now serving in Britain's New Armies (as among
			those who, whilst serving, have passed to their
			long rest) are very many thousands who are just
			for all the world like the writer of these letters.
			I have watched and spoken with whole cadet-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>training
			battalions of them, seen them march past
			in column of fours, chins well up, arms aswing,
			eyes front, and hearts beating high with glad
			determination and pride&mdash;just because their
			chance has nearly come for doing precisely what
			the writer of these letters did: for treading the
			exact track he blazed, away back there in 1915;
			for the right to offer the same sort of effort he
			made, for God and King and Country; to guard
			the Right, and avenge the Wrong, and to shield
			Christendom and its liberties from a menace more
			deadly than any that the world's admitted barbarians
			and heathens ever offered.</p>

		<p>I know there are very many thousands of them
			who are just like this particular "Temporary
			Gentleman,"&mdash;even as there must be many
			thousands of his like in America,&mdash;because there
			have been so many among those with whom I have
			lived and worked and fought, in the trenches.
			And it does seem to me, after study of the letters,
			that this statement forms something of a tribute
			to the spirit, the efficiency, and the devotion to
			their duty, of the whole tribe of the Temporary
			Officers.</p>

		<p>Their lost sense of humour (withered out of
			existence, I take it, by the poison gas of Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
			<i>Kultur</i>) would seem to have made the German
			nation literally incapable of forming an approximately
			correct estimate of the capacities of any
			people outside the confines of their own machine-made,
			despotically ordered State, in which public
			sentiment and opinion is manufactured from
			"sealed pattern" recipes kept under lock and key
			in Potsdam and the Wilhelmstrasse. Their blunders
			in psychology since July, 1914, would have
			formed an unparalleled comedy of errors, if they
			had not, instead, produced a tragedy unequalled
			in history. With regard to America alone, the
			record of their mistakes and misreadings would
			fill a stout volume. In the earlier days of the
			War, I read many German statements which
			purported (very solemnly) to prove:</p>

		<p>(<i>a</i>) That in the beginning of the War they
			killed off all the British officers.</p>

		<p>(<i>b</i>) That the British officer material had long
			since been exhausted.</p>

		<p>(<i>c</i>) That, since it was impossible for the
			British to produce more officers, they could not
			by any effort place a really big Army in the field.</p>

		<p>And the queer thing is that German machine-made
			illusions are of cast-iron. They "stay
			put"; permanently. During 1917 I read again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
			precisely the same fatuous German statement
			regarding America and her inability to produce
			an army, that one read in 1914 and 1915 about
			Britain. The British New Armies (which Germany
			affirmed could never seriously count) have
			succeeded in capturing nearly three times as many
			prisoners as they have lost, and more than four
			times as many guns. From 1916 onward they
			steadily hammered back the greatest concentrations
			of German military might that Hindenburg
			could put up, and did not lose in the whole period
			as much ground as they have won in a single day
			from the Kaiser's legions. Yet still, in 1917, the
			same ostrich-like German scribes, who vowed that
			Britain could not put an army in the field because
			they could never officer it, were repeating precisely
			the same foolish talk about America and her
			New Armies.</p>

		<p>Perhaps there is only one argument which
			Germany is now really able to appreciate. That
			argument has been pointedly, and very effectively,
			presented for some time past by the writer of these
			letters, and all his comrades. From this stage
			onward, it will further be pressed home upon the
			German by the armies of America, whose potentialities
			he has laboriously professed to ridicule.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
			It is the argument of high explosive and cold
			steel; the only argument capable of bringing ultimate
			conviction to the Wilhelmstrasse that the
			English-speaking peoples, though they may know
			nothing of the goose-step, yet are not wont to cry
			"Kamerad," or to offer surrender to any other
			people on earth.</p>

		<p>I know very well that the writer of these letters
			had no thought as he wrote&mdash;back there in 1916&mdash;of
			any kind of argument or reply to Potsdamed
			fantasies. But yet I would submit that, all
			unwittingly, he has furnished in these letters (on
			America's behalf, as well as Britain's) what should
			prove for unprejudiced readers outside Germany
			a singularly telling answer to the Boche's foolish
			boasts of the Anglo-Saxon inability to produce
			officers. As a correspondent in the Press recently
			wrote: "Why, for generations past the English-speaking
			peoples have been officering the world and
			all its waters&mdash;especially its waters!" And so
			they have, as all the world outside Germany
			knows, from the Yukon to Tierra del Fuego;
			from the Atlantic round through the Philippines to
			the golden gate and back.</p>

		<p>It is a high sense of honour, horse sense, and
			sportsmanship, in our Anglo-Saxon sense, that lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
			at the root of successful leadership. And one of
			Prussia's craziest illusions was that with us,
			these qualities were the sole monopoly of the men
			who kept polo ponies and automobiles!</p>

		<p>Only the guns of the Allies and the steel of their
			dauntless infantrymen can enlighten a people so
			hopelessly deluded as the Germans of to-day.
			But for the rest of the world I believe there is
			much in this little collection of the frank, unstudied
			writings of an average New Army officer, who,
			prior to the War, was a clerk in a suburban office,
			to show that sportsmanship and leadership are
			qualities characteristic of every single division
			of the Anglo-Saxon social systems; and that,
			perhaps more readily than any other race, we can
			produce from every class and every country in the
			English-speaking half of the world, men who make
			the finest possible kind of active service officers;
			men who, though their commissions may be
			"Temporary" and their names innocent of a
			"von," or any other prefix, are not only fine
			officers, but, permanently, and by nature, gentlemen
			and sportsmen.</p>

		<p>Withal, it may be that I should be falling short
			of complete fulfilment of a duty which I am glad
			and proud to discharge, if I omitted to furnish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
			any further information regarding the personality
			of the writer of these letters. And so, if the reader
			will excuse yet another page or two of wire entanglement
			between himself and the actual trenches&mdash;the
			letters, I mean&mdash;I will try to explain.</p>

		<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="THE_GENESIS_OF_THE_TEMPORARY" id="THE_GENESIS_OF_THE_TEMPORARY"></a>THE GENESIS OF THE "TEMPORARY
				GENTLEMAN"</h2></div>

		<p>In the case of the Service Battalion officer of
			Britain's New Army who, with humorous modesty,
			signs himself "Your 'Temporary Gentleman,'"
			what is there behind that enigmatic signature that
			his letters do not tell us? The first of these
			homely epistles shows their writer arriving with
			his Battalion in France; and the visit is evidently
			his first to that fair land, since he writes: "I
			wonder if I should ever have seen it had there
			been no war!" That exclamation tells a good
			deal.</p>

		<p>But of the man and his antecedents prior to that
			moment of landing with his unit in France, the
			letters tell us nothing; and if it be true that the
			war has meant being "born again" for very many
			Englishmen, that frequently quoted statement at
			all events points to the enjoyment of some definite
			status before the war.</p>

		<p>Inquiry in this particular case speedily brings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
			home to one the fact that one is investigating the
			antecedents of a well-recognised New Army type, a
			thoroughly representative type, as well as those of
			an individual. In his antecedents, as in the revolutionary
			development which the war has brought
			to him, this "Temporary Gentleman" is clearly
			one among very many thousands who have, so to
			say, passed through the same crucibles, been submitted
			to the same standard tests, and emerged
			in the trenches of France and Flanders, in Gallipoli
			and in Mesopotamia, in Africa, and in other places
			in which the common enemy has endeavoured
			to uphold his proposed substitution of <i>Kultur</i> for
			civilisation, as we understand it.</p>

		<p>In the year 1896 there died, in a south-western
			suburb of London, a builder and contractor in a
			small, suburban way of business. An industrious,
			striving, kindly, and honourable man, he had had a
			number of different irons in the fire, as the saying
			goes, and some of them, it may be, would have provided
			a good reward for his industry if he had
			lived. As the event proved, however, the winding-up
			of his affairs produced for his widow a sum
			representing no more than maintenance upon a
			very modest scale of a period of perhaps three
			years. The widow was not alone in the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
			She had a little daughter, aged five, and a sturdy
			son, aged eight years. Nineteen years later that
			boy, into whose youth and early training not
			even the mention of anything military ever crept,
			was writing letters home from fire trenches in
			France, and signing them "Your 'Temporary
			Gentleman.'"</p>

		<p>For seven years after his father's death the boy
			attended a day school in Brixton. The tuition he
			there received was probably inferior in many ways
			to that which would have fallen to his lot in one of
			the big establishments presided over by the County
			Council. But his mother's severely straitened
			circumstances had rather strengthened than lowered
			her natural pride; and she preferred to enlarge
			the sphere of her necessary sacrifices, and by the
			practice of the extremest thrift and industry to
			provide for the teaching of her two children at
			private schools. The life of the fatherless little
			family was necessarily a narrow one; its horizon
			was severely restricted, but its respectability was
			unimpeachable; and within the close-set walls of
			the little Brixton home there never was seen any
			trace of baseness, of coarseness, or of what is
			called vulgarity. The boy grew up in an atmosphere
			of reticence and modesty, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
			dominant factors were thrift, duty, conscientiousness,
			and deep-rooted family affection.</p>

		<p>The first epoch of his fatherless life closed when
			our "Temporary Gentleman" left school, at the
			age of fifteen, and mounted a stool in the office of a
			local auctioneer and estate agent, who, in the
			previous decade, had had satisfactory business
			dealings with the youth's father. This notable
			event introduced some change into the quiet little
			mother-ruled <i>ménage</i>; for, in a sense, it had to be
			recognised that, with the bringing home of his
			first week's pay, the boy threatened to become a
			man. The patient mother was at once proud and
			a little disconcerted. But, upon the whole, pride
			ruled. The boy's mannishness, brought up as he
			had been, did not take on any very disconcerting
			shapes, though the first cigarette he produced in
			the house, not very long after the conclusion of the
			South African War, did prove something of a
			disturbing element just at first.</p>

		<p>The South African War affected this little household,
			perhaps, as much as it would have been
			affected by a disastrous famine in China. It
			came before the period at which the son of the
			house started bringing home an evening newspaper,
			and while the only periodicals to enter the home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
			were still <i>The Boy's Own Paper</i> and a weekly
			journal concerned with dressmaking and patterns.
			As a topic of conversation it was not mentioned
			half a dozen times in that household from first to
			last.</p>

		<p>The next really great event in the life of the
			auctioneer's clerk was his purchase of a bicycle,
			which, whilst catastrophic in its effect upon his
			Post Office Savings Bank account, was in other
			respects a source of great happiness to him. And
			if it meant something of a wrench to his mother, as
			a thing calculated to remove her boy a little farther
			beyond the narrow confines of the sphere of her
			exclusive domination, she never allowed a hint of
			this to appear. Her son's admirable physique
			had long been a source of considerable pride to
			her; and she had wisely encouraged his assiduity
			in the Polytechnic gymnasium of which he was a
			valued supporter.</p>

		<p>For the youth himself, his bicycle gave him the
			key of a new world, whilst robbing the cricket and
			football clubs to which he belonged of a distinctly
			useful member. He became an amateur of rural
			topography, learned in all the highways and by-ways
			of the southern Home Counties. His radius
			may not have exceeded fifty miles, but yet his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
			bicycle interpreted England to him in a new light,
			as something infinitely greater and more beautiful
			than Brixton.</p>

		<p>Quietly, evenly, the years slid by. The boy became
			a youth and the youth a man; and, in a
			modest way, the man prospered, becoming the
			most important person, next to its proprietor,
			in the estate agent's business. The mother's life
			became easier, and the sister (who had become a
			school-teacher) owed many little comforts and
			pleasures to the consistent kindliness of one who
			now was admittedly the head of the little household
			and its chief provider. He never gave a
			thought to the State or felt the smallest kind of
			interest in politics; yet his life was in no way
			self-centred or selfish, but, on the contrary, one in
			which the chief motive was the service of those
			nearest and dearest to him. Whilst rarely looking
			inward, his outward vision was bounded by
			the horizon of his well-ordered little home, of the
			Home Counties he had learned to love, and of the
			south-coast seaside village in which the family
			spent a happy fortnight every summer.</p>

		<p>They were in that little seaside village when the
			Huns decreed war and desolation for Europe in
			August, 1914, and the three were a good deal upset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
			about the whole business, for it interfered with the
			railway service, and broke in very unpleasantly
			upon the holiday atmosphere, which, coming as it
			did for but one fortnight in each year, was exceedingly
			precious to the little family. However,
			with the Englishman's instinct for clinging to the
			established order, with all the national hatred of
			disturbance, they clung as far as possible to the
			measured pleasantness of their holiday routine,
			and, after a week, returned to the workaday
			round of life in Brixton.</p>

		<p>Then began a time of peculiar stress and anxiety
			for the little household, the dominating factor in
			which was the growing strangeness, as it seemed to
			them, of its actual head and ruler; of the man in
			the house. At first he talked a great deal of the
			war, the overpowering news of the day, and he
			passed many scathing criticisms upon the conduct
			of the authorities in their handling of the first
			stages of the monstrous work of preparation. He
			had much to say of their blunders and oversights;
			and somewhat, too, of what he called their criminal
			unpreparedness. He stopped talking rather
			abruptly at breakfast one morning; and one of the
			headlines which subsequently caught the eyes of
			his sister, in the newspaper her brother had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
			propped against the coffee-pot, put this inquiry,
			in bold black type:</p>

			<blockquote><p>"WHOSE FAULT IS IT, MR. CITIZEN, THAT THE
				COUNTRY IS UTTERLY UNPREPARED FOR WAR?"</p></blockquote>

		<p>Those nightmarish early days of the great war
			slowly succeeded one another, and the mother and
			daughter grew perturbed over the change they saw
			creeping over their man. He talked hardly at all
			now. All the old cheery, kindly good humour
			which had provided half the sunshine of their lives
			seemed to be disappearing and giving place to a
			queer, nervous, morose sort of depression. It was
			as if their man lived a double life. Clearly he
			was much affected, even absorbed, by some mental
			process which he never so much as mentioned to
			them. Morning and evening they saw him, and
			yet it was as though he was not there, as though
			he lived and had his being in some other world,
			aloof from the old cosy, familiar, shared world in
			which they had always been together. The house-wifely
			eye of his mother noted with something like
			alarm that his bedroom candlestick required a
			fresh candle every day. One had been wont to
			serve him for a fortnight. Always, she thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
			he would unburden himself when he kissed her
			good-night. But he said never a word; and the
			nerve strain in the little household, which had
			been so quietly happy and bright, became almost
			unendurable.</p>

		<p>Then the end came, with the beginning of the
			third week in September. The evening was extraordinarily
			peaceful and fine. The sister and a girl
			friend were at the little cottage piano. The visitor
			had a rather rich contralto voice, and sang with
			considerable feeling. In the middle of her third
			song the master of the house rose abruptly and
			walked out of the room, closing the door sharply
			behind him. The song was one of those called a
			"recruiting song." Late that night, when the
			visitor had departed, the brother apologised to his
			mother and sister for leaving them so abruptly,
			and spoke of a sudden headache. And the next
			evening he brought home the devastating news
			that he had enlisted, and would be leaving them
			next day for a military depot.</p>

		<p>The news was received in dead silence. In some
			mysterious way neither of the women had contemplated
			this as possible. For others, yes. For
			their man&mdash;the thing was too wildly, remotely
			strange to be possible. There was his business;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
			and, besides&mdash;It was merely impossible. And
			now he was an enlisted soldier, he told them.
			But, though they hardly suspected it, not being
			given to the practice of introspection, their man
			was not the only member of the little household
			in whom a fundamental and revolutionary change
			had been wrought by the world-shaking news of
			the past six weeks. In the end the women kissed
			their man, and the central fact of his astounding
			intelligence was not discussed at all. They proceeded
			direct to practical, material arrangements.
			But when the time came for her good-night kiss,
			the mother said, very quietly, "God bless you,
			dear!"; and the sister smiled and showed a new
			pride through the wet gleam of her eyes.</p>

		<p>And then the auctioneer's clerk disappeared
			from the peaceful purlieus of Brixton and went out
			alone into an entirely new world, the like of which
			had never presented itself to his fancy, even in
			dreams. He became one of fifteen men whose
			home was a bell tent designed to give easy shelter
			to perhaps half that number. He began to spend
			his days in a routine of drill which, even to him
			with his gymnasium training, seemed most singularly
			tiresome and meaningless&mdash;at first.</p>

		<p>At the end of four weeks he returned home for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
			Saturday night and Sunday in the Brixton house;
			and he wore one stripe on the sleeve of his service
			jacket. To his intelligence there now was nothing
			in the whole intricate round of section, platoon, and
			company drill which was meaningless, however
			wearing it might sometimes seem. There was a
			tan on his cheeks, a clear brightness in his eyes,
			an alert swing in his carriage, and a surprisingly
			crisp ring in his voice which at once bewildered
			and delighted his womenfolk. He seemed not so
			much a new man as the man whom they had
			always loved and respected, in some subtle way
			magnified, developed, tuned up, brought to concert
			pitch.</p>

		<p>In November he was advised by his Company
			Commander to apply for a Commission. The
			officer badly wanted him for a Sergeant, but this
			officer had long since learned to place duty first
			and inclination a long way behind; and it was
			apparent to him that in this tall, alert Lance-Corporal
			of his, as in so many hundreds of other
			men in the ranks, there was the making of a good
			officer.</p>

		<p>Shortly before Christmas, 1914, he was gazetted
			a Second Lieutenant, and on New Year's Day he
			found himself walking across a parade ground to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
			take his place in front of the platoon he subsequently
			led in France, after long months of arduous
			training in several different English camps.</p>

		<p>Three-quarters of a year passed between the
			day of this "Temporary Gentleman's" enlistment
			and his writing of the first of the letters now published
			over his pseudonym; and it may well be
			that all the previous years of his life put together
			produced no greater modification and development
			in the man than came to him in those nine months
			of training for the New Army. The training had
			its bookish side, for he was very thorough; but it
			was in the open air from dawn till dark, and
			ninety per cent. of it came to him in the process
			of training others.</p>

		<p>The keynotes of the training were <i>noblesse oblige</i>,
			sportsmanship and responsibility, that form of
			"playing the game" which is at the root of the
			discipline of the British Army. While he taught
			the men of his platoon they taught him, in every
			hour of the day and many hours of the night.
			They learned to call him "A pretty good sort,"
			which is very high praise indeed. And he learned
			to be as jealous of his men as any mother can be of
			her children. He learned to know them, in fair
			weather and in foul, for the splendid fellows they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
			are; and in the intensely proud depths of his own
			inner consciousness to regard them as the finest
			platoon in the New Army.</p>

		<p>And then came the longed-for day of the departure
			for France, for the land he was to learn to
			love, despite all the horrors of its long fighting
			line, just as he learned most affectionately to admire
			the men and reverence the women of brave,
			beautiful France. In the letters that he wrote
			from France he had, of course, no faintest thought
			of the ultimate test of publication. That is one
			reason why his name is not now attached to documents
			so intimate, even apart from the sufficiently
			obvious military reasons.</p>

			A "Temporary Gentleman" in France

		<div class="chapter">
		<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="THE_FIRST_LETTER" id="THE_FIRST_LETTER"></a>THE FIRST LETTER</h2></div>

		<p>Here we are at last, "Somewhere in France,"
			and I suppose this will be the first letter you have
			ever had from your "Temporary Gentleman"
			which hasn't a stamp on it. It is rather nice to
			be able to post without stamps, and I hope the
			Censor will find nothing to object to in what I
			write. It's hard to know where to begin.</p>

		<p>Here we are "at last," I say&mdash;we were nearly
			a year training at home, you know&mdash;and I shall
			not easily forget our coming. It really was a
			wonderful journey from Salisbury Plain, with
			never a hitch of any sort or kind, or so much as a
			buttonstick gone astray. Someone with a pretty
			good head-piece must arrange these things. At
			ten minutes to three this morning we were on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
			parade ground at &mdash;&mdash; over a thousand strong.
			At twenty minutes to eleven we marched down
			the wharf here at &mdash;&mdash;, well, somewhere in France;
			and soon after twelve the cook-house bugle went
			in this camp, high up on a hill outside the town,
			and we had our first meal in France&mdash;less than
			eight hours from our huts on the Plain; not quite
			the Front yet, but La Belle France, all the same.
			I wonder if I should ever have seen it had there
			been no war?</p>

		<p>Our transport, horses, mules, and limbers had
			gone on ahead by another route. But, you know,
			the carrying of over a thousand men is no small
			matter, when you accomplish it silently, without
			delay, and with all the compact precision of a battalion
			parade, as this move of ours was managed.
			Three minutes after our train drew up at the
			harbour station, over there in England, the four
			companies, led by Headquarters Staff, and the
			band (with our regimental hound pacing in front)
			were marching down the wharf in column of route,
			with a good swing. There were four gangways,
			and we filed on board the steamer as if it had
			been the barrack square. Then off packs and into
			lifebelts every man; and in ten minutes the Battalion
			was eating its haversack breakfast ration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
			and the steamer was nosing out to the open sea,
			heading for France, the Front, and Glory.</p>

		<p>The trip across was a stirring experience in its
			way too. The wide sea, after all, is just as open
			to the Boche as to us, and he is pretty well off for
			killing craft and mines. Yet, although through
			these long months we have been carrying troops
			to and fro every day, not once has he been able
			to check us in the Channel. The way the Navy's
			done its job is&mdash;it's just a miracle of British discipline
			and efficiency. All across the yellow foam-flecked
			sea our path was marked out for us like
			a racecourse, and outside the track we could see
			the busy little mine-sweepers hustling to and fro
			at their police work, guarding the highway for
			the British Army. Not far from us, grim and
			low, like a greyhound extended, a destroyer slid
			along: our escort.</p>

		<p>The thing thrilled you, like a scene in a play;
			the quiet Masters of the Sea guarding us on our
			way to fight the blustering, boastful, would-be
			stealers of the earth. And from first to last I
			never heard a single order shouted. There was
			not a single hint of flurry.</p>

		<p>It is about seven hours now since we landed,
			and I feel as though we had been weeks away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
			already&mdash;I suppose because there is so much to
			see. And yet it doesn't seem very foreign, really;
			and if only I could remember some of the French
			we were supposed to learn at school, so as to be
			able to understand what the people in the street
			are talking about, it would be just like a fresh
			bit of England. Although, just a few hours away,
			with no sea between us, there's the Hun, with
			his poison gas and his Black Marias and all the
			rest of the German outfit. Well, we've brought
			a good chunk of England here since the war began;
			solid acres of bully beef and barbed wire,
			condensed milk and galvanised iron, Maconochie
			rations, small-arm ammunition, biscuits, hand
			grenades, jam, picks and shovels, cheese, rifles,
			butter, boots, and pretty well everything else
			you can think of; all neatly stacked in miles of
			sheds, and ready for the different units on our
			Front.</p>

		<p>I think the French are glad to see us. They
			have a kind of a welcoming way with them, in
			the streets and everywhere, that makes you feel
			as though, if you're not actually at home, you
			are on a visit to your nearest relations. A jolly,
			cheery, kindly good-natured lot they are, in spite
			of all the fighting in their own country and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
			the savage destruction the Huns have brought.
			The people in the town are quite keen on our
			drums and bugles; marching past them is like a
			review. It makes you "throw a chest" no matter
			what your pack weighs; and we are all carrying
			truck enough to stock a canteen with. The
			kiddies run along and catch you by the hand. The
			girls&mdash;there are some wonderfully pretty girls
			here, who have a kind of a way with them, a sort
			of style that is French, I suppose; it's pretty
			taking, anyhow&mdash;they wave their handkerchiefs
			and smile. "Bon chance!" they tell you. And you
			feel they really mean "Good luck!" I like these
			people, and they seem to like us pretty well. As
			for men, you don't see many of them about.
			They are in the fighting line, except the quite
			old ones. And the way the women carry on their
			work is something fine. All with such a jolly
			swing and a laugh; something brave and taking
			and fine about them all.</p>

		<p>If this writing seems a bit ragged you must
			excuse it. The point of my indelible pencil seems
			to wear down uncommonly fast; I suppose because
			of the rough biscuit box that is my table.
			We are in a tent, with a rather muddy boarded
			floor, and though the wind blows mighty cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
			and keen outside, we are warm as toast in here.
			I fancy we shall be here till to-morrow night.
			Probably do a route march round the town and
			show ourselves off to-morrow. The C. O. rather
			fancies himself in the matter of our band and the
			Battalion's form in marching. We're not bad,
			you know; and "A" Company, of course, is
			pretty nearly the last word. "Won't be much
			sleep for the Kaiser after 'A' Company gets to
			the Front," says "the Peacemaker." We call our
			noble company commander "the Peacemaker,"
			or sometimes "Ramsay Angell," as I think I
			must have told you before, because he's so deadly
			keen on knuckle-duster daggers and things of
			that sort. "Three inches over the right kidney,
			and when you hear his quiet cough you can pass
			on to the next Boche," says "the Peacemaker,"
			when he is showing off a new trench dagger.
			Sort of, "And the next article, please," manner
			he has, you know; and we all like him for it. It's
			his spirit that's made "A" Company what it is.
			I don't mean that we call him "the Peacemaker"
			to his face, you know.</p>

		<p>We can't be altogether war-worn veterans or
			old campaigners yet, I suppose, though it does
			seem much more than seven hours since we landed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
			But everyone agrees there's something about us
			that we did not have last year&mdash;I mean yesterday.
			From the Colonel down to the last man in
			from the depot we've all got it; and though I
			don't know what it is, it makes a lot of difference.
			I think it is partly that there isn't any more "Out
			there" with us now. It's "Out here." And
			everything that came before to-day is "Over in
			England," you know; ever so far away. I don't
			know why a man should feel more free here than
			in England. But there it is. The real thing,
			the thing we've all been longing for, the thing
			we joined for, seems very close at hand now, and,
			naturally, you know, everyone wants to do his
			bit. It's funny to hear our fellows talking, as
			though the Huns were round the corner. If
			there's anything a man doesn't like&mdash;a sore heel,
			or a split canteen of stew, or a button torn off&mdash;"We'll
			smarten the Boche for that," they say, or,
			"Righto! That's another one in for the Kaiser!"</p>

		<p>You would have thought we should have had
			time during the past six months or so to have
			put together most of the little things a campaigner
			wants, wouldn't you? especially seeing that a
			man has to carry all his belongings about with
			him and yet I would make a sporting bet that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
			there are not half a dozen men in the Battalion
			who have bought nothing to carry with them to-day.
			There is a Y. M. C. A. hut and a good canteen
			in this camp, and there has been a great
			business done in electric torches, tooth-powder,
			chocolate, knives, pipe-lighters, and all manner
			of notions. We are all very glad to be here, very
			glad; and nine out of ten will dream to-night of
			trenches in France and the Push we all mean to
			win V.C.'s in. But that's not to say we shall
			forget England and the&mdash;the little things we care
			about at home. Now I'm going to turn in for
			my first sleep in France. So give what you have
			to spare of my love to all whom it may concern,
			and accept the rest yourself from your</p>

		<div class="chapter">

		<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="THE_FIRST_MARCH" id="THE_FIRST_MARCH"></a>THE FIRST MARCH</h2></div>

		<p>We reached this long, straggling village in pale
			starlight a little after six this morning; and with
			it the welcome end of the first stage of our journey
			from the port of disembarking to our section
			of the French Front.</p>

		<p>In all the months of our training in England I
			never remember to have seen "A" Company anything
			like so tired; and we had some pretty gruelling
			times, too, during those four-day divisional
			stunts and in the chalk trenches on the Plain;
			and again in the night ops. on the heather of those
			North Yorkshire moors. But "A" Company
			was never so tired as when we found our billets
			here this morning. Yet we were in better form
			than any other company in the Battalion; and
			I'm quite sure no other Battalion in the Brigade
			could march against our fellows.</p>

		<p>The whole thing is a question of what one has
			to carry. Just now, of course, we are carrying
			every blessed thing we possess, including great-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>coats
			and blankets, not to mention stocks of
			'baccy, torches, maps, stationery, biscuits, and
			goodness knows what besides; far fuller kits, no
			doubt, than tried campaigners ever have. (I
			found little M&mdash;&mdash;, of No. 3 Platoon, surreptitiously
			stuffing through a hedge a case of patent
			medicines, including cough-mixture and Mother
			Somebody's Syrup!) If you ever visit France you
			probably won't travel on your own ten toes; but
			if you should, be advised by me and cut your kit
			down to the barest minimum; and when you've
			done that, throw away a good half of what's left.</p>

		<p>Boots and socks. Some people will tell you
			that stocks and shares and international politics
			are matters of importance. I used to think the
			pattern of my neckties made a difference to our
			auctions. I know now that the really big things,
			the things that are really important, are socks
			and boots, and hot coffee and sleep, and bread&mdash;"Pang&mdash;Compree?"
			says Tommy to the French
			women, with a finger at his mouth&mdash;and then
			socks and boots again. You thought we paid a
			good deal in the shop for those swanky trench
			boots, W&mdash;&mdash; and myself. That was nothing to
			what we've paid since for wearing 'em. Excellent
			trench boots, I dare say; but one has to walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
			across a good bit of France before getting to the
			trenches, you know. Those boots are much too
			heavy to carry and no good for marching. They
			look jolly and workmanlike, you know, but they
			eat up too much of one's heels. Tell all the officers
			you know to come out in ordinary marching boots,
			good ones, but ordinary ankle boots. Plenty
			time to get trench boots when they get to the
			trenches. Good old Q.M. Dept. will see to that.
			Our respected O.C. Company had no horse, you
			know (we haven't yet made connection with our
			transport), and his heels to-day look like something
			in the steak line about half-grilled.</p>

		<p>We left camp at the port I mustn't name about
			eight o'clock last night, and marched down the
			hill to the station in sort of thoughtful good spirits,
			the packs settling down into their grooves. To
			save adding its immensity to my pack, I wore my
			imposing trench coat, with its sheep-skin lining;
			waist measurement over all, say a hundred and
			twenty-five. Two of us had some difficulty about
			ramming "the Peacemaker," through his carriage
			door into the train, he also being splendid in a
			multi-lined trench coat. Then we mostly mopped
			up perspiration and went to sleep.</p>

		<p>Between twelve and one o'clock in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
			we left the train (not without emotion; it was a
			friendly, comfortable train), and started to march
			across France. The authorities, in their godlike
			way, omitted to give us any information as to
			how far we were to march. But the weather was
			fine, and "A" Company moved off with a good
			swing, to the tune of their beloved "Keep the
			Camp Fires Burning." The biggest of packs
			seems a trifle, you know, immediately after four
			hours' rest in a train. But after the first hour
			it's astonishing how its importance in your scheme
			of things grows upon you; and at the end of the
			third or fourth hour you are very glad to stuff
			anything like bottles of Mother Somebody's
			Syrup through a gap in the nearest hedge.</p>

		<p>It was at about that stage that word reached us
			of one or two men falling out from the rear companies.
			At this "the Peacemaker" began jogging
			up and down the left of our Company&mdash;we march
			on the right of the road in France&mdash;and, for all his
			sore heels and tremendous coat, showing the
			skittishness of a two-year-old. And he's even
			good years older than any of the rest of us, or
			than anyone else in the Company. I chipped my
			fellows into starting up another song, and my
			Platoon Sergeant cheerfully passed the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
			round that if anybody in No. 1 dared to fall out
			he'd disembowel him with a tin-opener.</p>

		<p>As an actual fact not a single "A" Company
			man did fall out, though in the last lap I was a bit
			nervy about old Tommy Dodd in 3 Section, whose
			rifle I carried, and one or two others. At the end
			"the Peacemaker" was carrying the rifles of two
			men, and everybody was thankful for walls to
			lean against when we stood easy in this village.
			My chaps were splendid.</p>

		<p>"Stick it, Tommy Dodd!" I said to the old boy
			once, near the end. His good old face was all
			twisted with the pain of his feet and the mass of
			extra kit which no doubt his wife had made him
			carry.</p>

		<p>"Stick it!" says he, with his twisted grin.
			"Why, I'm just beginning to enjoy it, sir. Just
			getting into me stride, I am. I wouldn't 've
			missed this for all the beer in England, sir. But
			you wait till we get alongside them blighted
			Boches, sir, an' see if I don't smarten some of
			'em for this. I'll give 'em sore 'eels!"</p>

		<p>It was only by lying to the extent of at least
			ten years that the old thing was able to enlist, and
			you couldn't get him to "go sick" if you drove
			him with a whip. The only way old Tommy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
			Dodd's spirit could be broken would be if you
			sent him to the depot and refused him his chance
			of "smartening them blighted Boches."</p>

		<p>Everyone in the village was asleep when we got
			there, but on the door we found chalked up (as it
			might be "Lot So-and-so" at a sale) "1 Officer,
			25 men, 'A' Coy.," and so on. We officers shed
			our packs and coats in the road&mdash;the joy of that
			shedding!&mdash;and went round with our platoons
			picking out their quarters, and shepherding them
			in before they could fall asleep. We knocked up
			the inhabitants, who came clattering out in clogs,
			with candle-ends in big lanterns. Most remarkably
			cheery and good-natured they all seemed, for
			that time of day; mostly women, you know, you
			don't find many home-staying men in France to-day.
			The most of the men's billets are barns and
			granaries, and there is a good supply of straw. I
			can tell you there was no need to sound any
			"Lights Out" or "Last Post." No. 1 Platoon
			just got down into their straw like one man, and
			no buck at all about it.</p>

		<p>Then when we had seen them all fixed up, we
			foraged round for our own billets. Mine proved
			a little brick-floored apartment, in which you might
			just swing a very small cat if you felt like that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
			kind of jugglery, opening out of the main room,
			or bar, of an estaminet&mdash;the French village version
			of our inn, you know. Here, when they
			had had their sleep, the men began to flock this
			afternoon for refreshment. The drinking is quite
			innocent, mostly café au lait, and occasionally
			cider. The sale of spirits is (very wisely) entirely
			prohibited. It's most amusing to hear our
			chaps "slinging the bat." They are still at the
			stage of thinking that if they shout loudly enough
			they must be understood, and it is rather as a sort
			of good-humoured concession to the eccentricities
			of our French hosts, than with any idea of tackling
			another language, that they throw in their "Bon
			jor's" and the like.</p>

		<p>"Got any pang, Mum?" they ask cheerfully.
			Another repeats it, in a regular open-air auction
			shout, with a grin and an interrogative "Compree?"
			at the end of each remark. Some, still at the top
			of their voices, are even bold enough to try
			instructing the French. "Françaisee, 'pang'&mdash;see?
			In Engletairy, 'bread'&mdash;see? Compree?
			<span class="smcap">B-R-E-A-D</span>, bread." And the kindly French women,
			with their smiling lips and anxious, war-worn
			eyes, they nod and acquiesce, and bustle in and
			out with yard-long loaves and bowls of coffee of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
			precisely the same size as the diminutive wash-hand
			basin in my room. I tell you one's heart
			warms to these French women, in their workmanlike
			short frocks (nearly all black), thick, home-knitted
			stockings, and wooden clogs. How they
			keep the heels of their stockings so dry and clean,
			I can't think. The subject, you notice, is one of
			peculiar interest to all of us just now&mdash;sock heels,
			I mean.</p>

		<p>There have been a good many jobs for officers
			all day, so far, and only an hour or so for rest.
			But we have arranged for a sumptuous repast&mdash;roast
			duck and sausages and treacle pudding&mdash;at
			six o'clock, and the C.O. and Providence permitting,
			we shall all turn in before eight. We
			don't expect to move on from here till early the
			day after to-morrow, and shall have our transport
			with us by then. I gather we shall march all
			the way from here to the trenches; and really,
			you know, it's an excellent education for all of
			us in the conditions of the country. People at
			home don't realise what a big thing the domestic
			side of soldiering is. Our C.O. knew, of course,
			because he is an old campaigner. That's why,
			back there in England, he harried his officers as
			he did. We have to know all there is to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
			about the feet, boots, socks, food, cleanliness, and
			health of each one of our men, and it has been
			made part of our religion that an officer must
			never, never, never eat, sleep, or rest until he has
			personally seen to it that each man in his command
			is provided for in these respects. He has made it
			second nature to us, and since we reached France
			one has learned the wisdom of his teaching. I
			must clear out now&mdash;a pow-wow at Battalion
			Orderly Room: the village Ecole des Filles. The
			weather has completely changed. There's a
			thin, crisp coating of snow over everything, and
			it's clear and dry and cold. We're all rather tired,
			but fit as fleas, and awfully thankful to be getting
			so near the firing line. So make your mind quite
			easy about your</p>

		<p>If inclined to revile me for apparent neglect of
			you these last few days, be charitable and revile
			lightly.</p>

		<p>It's astonishing how full one's days are. And
			then when late evening arrives and arrangements
			for next morning are complete, and one's been the
			round of one's platoon billets and seen all in order
			for the night&mdash;then, instead of being free to write
			one's own letters, one must needs wade through
			scores written by the men of one's platoon, who&mdash;lucky
			beggars!&mdash;have three times the leisure
			we can ever get. Their letters must all be censored
			and initialed, you see. Rightly enough, I
			suppose, the military principle seems to be never
			to allow the private soldier to be burdened by any
			responsibility which an officer can possibly take.
			The giving away of military information in a
			letter, whether inadvertently or knowingly, is,
			of course, a serious offence. (German spies are
			everywhere.) When I have endorsed all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
			platoon's letters, the responsibility for their
			contents rests on my shoulders and the men run
			no risks.</p>

		<p>If I were an imitative bird now, you would find
			my letter reading something after this style:</p>

		<p>"Just a few lines to let you know how we are
			getting on, hoping this finds you in the pink as it
			leaves me at present. We are getting very near
			the Germans now, and you can take it from me
			they'll get what for when we come up with 'em.
			The grub here is champion, but we are always
			ready for more, and I shan't be sorry to get that
			parcel you told me of. Please put in a few fags
			next time. The French people have a queer way
			of talking so you can't always understand all
			they say, but they're all right, I can tell you,
			when you get to know 'em, and I can sling their
			bat like one o'clock now. It's quite easy once
			you get the hang of it, this bong jor and pang
			parley voo. Milk is lay, and not too easy to get.
			The boys are all in the pink, and hoping you're
			the same, so no more at present," etc.</p>

		<p>One sometimes gets mad with them for trifles,
			but for all the things that really matter&mdash;God
			bless 'em all! By Jove! they <i>are</i> Britons. They're
			always "in the pink" and most things are "cham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>pion,"
			and when the ration-wagon's late and a
			man drops half his whack in the mud, he grins
			and says, "The Army of to-day's all <i>right</i>"; and
			that, wait till he gets into the trenches, he'll
			smarten the Boches up for that! Oh, but they
			are splendid; and though one gets into the way
			of thinking and saying one's own men are the best
			in the Army, yet, when one means business one
			knows very well the whole of the New Army's
			made of the same fine stuff. Why, in my platoon,
			and in our Company for that matter, they are every
			mother's son of them what people at home call
			rough, ignorant fellows. And I admit it. Rough
			they certainly are; and ignorant, too, by school
			standards. But, by Jingo! their hearts are in
			the right place, and I'd back any one of them
			against any two goose-stepping Boches in the
			Kaiser's Prussian Guard.</p>

		<p>And, with it all, mind you, they're so English.
			I mean they are <i>kind</i>, right through to their
			bones; good fellows, you know; sportsmen, every
			one of 'em; fellows you'd trust to look after your
			mother. They're as keen as mustard to get to
			the strafing of Boches; but that's because the
			Boche is the enemy, war is war, and duty is duty.
			You couldn't make haters of 'em, not if you paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
			'em all ambassadorial salaries to cultivate a scowl
			and sing hymns of hate. Not them. Not all
			the powers of Germany and Austria could make
			baby-killers, women-slayers, and church-destroyers
			of these chaps of ours. If I know anything
			about it, they are fine soldiers, but the Kaiser
			himself&mdash;"Kayser," they call him&mdash;couldn't make
			brutes and bullies of 'em. Warm their blood&mdash;and,
			mind you, you can do it easily enough,
			even with a football in a muddy field, when they've
			been on carrying fatigues all day&mdash;and, by Jove!
			there's plenty of devil in 'em. God help the
			men in front of 'em when they've bayonets
			fixed! But withal they're English sportsmen all
			the time, and a French child can empty their
			pockets and their haversacks by the shedding of
			a few tears.</p>

		<p>But I run on (and my candle runs down)
			and I give you no news. This is our last night
			here, and I ought to be asleep in my flea-bag, for
			we make an early start to-morrow for our first
			go in the trenches. But it's jolly yarning here
			to you, while the whole village is asleep, and no
			chits are coming in, and the Battalion Orderly
			Room over the way is black and silent as the
			grave, except for the sentry's footsteps in the mud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
			I'm in rather good quarters here, in the Mayor's
			house. When we left that first village&mdash;I'm afraid
			I haven't written since&mdash;we had three days of
			marching, sleeping in different billets each night.
			Here in this place, twelve miles from the firing
			line, we've had five days; practising with live
			bombs, getting issues of trench kit, and generally
			making last preparations. To-morrow night we
			sleep in tents close to the line and begin going
			into trenches for instruction.</p>

		<p>But, look here, before I turn in, I must just
			tell you about this household and my hot bath last
			night. The town is a queer little place; farming
			centre, you know. The farm-houses are all inside
			the village, and mine&mdash;M. le Maire's&mdash;is one of the
			best. From the street you see huge great double
			doors, that a laden wagon can drive through,
			in a white wall. That is the granary wall. You
			enter by the big archway into a big open yard,
			the centre part of which is a wide-spreading dung-hill
			and reservoir. All round the yard are sheds
			and stables enclosing it, and facing you at the
			back the low, long white house, with steps leading
			up to the front door, which opens into the kitchen.
			This is also the living-room of M. le Maire and
			his aged mother. Their family lived here before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
			the Revolution, and the three sturdy young women
			and one old, old man employed on the farm, all
			live in the house.</p>

		<p>M. le Maire is a warm man, reputed to have a
			thorough mastery of the English tongue, among
			other things, as a result of "college" education.
			So I gather from the really delightful old mother,
			who, though bent nearly double, appears to run
			the whole show, including the Town Hall opposite
			our Battalion Headquarters. I have never succeeded
			in inducing the Mayor to speak a word of
			English, but he has a little dictionary like a prayer-book,
			with perfectly blinding print, and somehow
			carries on long and apparently enjoyable conversations
			with my batman (who certainly has no
			French), though, as I say, one never heard a word
			of English on his lips.</p>

		<p>I know what the newspapers are. They pretend
			to give you the war news. But I'll bet they'll
			tell you nothing of yesterday's really great event,
			when the Commander of No. 1 Platoon took a
			hot bath, as it were under municipal auspices,
			attended by two Company Headquarters orderlies,
			his own batman, and the cordially expressed
			felicitations of his brother officers, not to mention
			the mayoral household, and the whole of No. 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
			Platoon, which is billeted in the Mayor's barns
			and outbuildings. Early in the day the best
			wash-tub had been commandeered for this interesting
			ceremony, and I fancy it has an even longer
			history behind it than the Mayor's pre-Revolution
			home. It is not definitely known that Marie
			Antoinette used this tub, bathing being an infrequent
			luxury in her day; but if she had been
			cursed with our modern craze for washing, and
			chanced to spend more than a year or so in this
			mud-set village of M&mdash;&mdash;, she certainly would have
			used this venerable vessel, which, I gather, began
			life as the half of a cider barrel, and still does duty
			of that sort on occasion, and as a receptacle for
			the storing of potatoes and other nutritious roots,
			when not required for the more intimate service
			of M. le Maire's mother, for the washing of M.
			le Maire's corduroys and underwear, or by M. le
			Maire himself, at the season of Michaelmas, I
			believe, in connection with the solemn rite of his
			own annual bath, which festival was omitted this
			year out of deference to popular opinion, because
			of the war.</p>

		<p>The household of the Mayor, headed by this
			respected functionary himself, received me at the
			portals of his ancestral home and ushered me most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
			kindly and graciously, if with a dash of grave,
			half-pitying commiseration, to what I thought at
			first was the family vault, though, as I presently
			discovered, it was in reality the mayoral salon or
			best parlour&mdash;as seen in war time&mdash;draped in
			sacking and year-old cobwebs. Here, after some
			rather embarrassing conversation, chiefly gesticulatory
			on my side&mdash;my conversational long suit
			is "Pas du tout! Merci beaucoup," and "Mais
			oui, Madame," with an occasional "Parfaitement,"
			stirred in now and again, not with any meaning,
			but as a kind of guarantee of good faith, because
			I think it sounds amiable, if not indeed like my
			lambs in their billets, "Bien gentil," and "Très
			convenable, Monsieur." It is thus they are invariably
			described to me when I go inspecting.
			As I was saying, here I was presently left alone
			with the household cat, two sick rabbits in a sort
			of cage which must once have housed a cockatoo
			or parrot, my own little towel (a torn half, you
			know, designed to reduce valise weight), my sponge
			(but, alack! not my dear old worn-out nail-brush,
			now lying in trenches on Salisbury Plain), and the
			prehistoric wash-tub, now one quarter filled by
			what the Mayor regarded, I gathered, as perhaps
			the largest quantity of hot water ever accum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>ulated
			in one place&mdash;two kettles and one oil-can
			full, carried by the orderlies.</p>

		<p>The cat and the rabbits watched my subsequent
			proceedings with the absorbed interest of
			an intelligent mid-Victorian infant at its first pantomime.
			The cat, I blush to say, was female,
			and old enough to know better, but I trust the
			rabbits were of my own sex. Anyhow, they were
			sick, so perhaps it doesn't matter. The entire
			mayoral household, with my batman and others,
			were assembled in the big kitchen, separated from
			the chamber of my ablutions only by a door having
			no kind of fastening and but one hinge. Their
			silence was broken only by an occasional profound
			sigh from the Mayor's aged mother, and three
			sounds of reflective expectoration at considerable
			intervals from the Mayor himself. So I judged
			my bathing to be an episode of rare and anxious
			interest to the mayoral family.</p>

		<p>My feet I anointed copiously with a disgusting
			unguent of great virtue&mdash;it's invaluable for lighting
			braziers when one's only fuel is muddy coke
			and damp chits&mdash;called anti-frostbite grease,
			that is said to guard us from the disease known as
			"Trench Feet," rumoured prevalent in our sector
			by reason of the mellow quality and depth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
			its mud, which, whilst apparently almost liquid,
			yet possesses enough body and bouquet&mdash;remember
			how you used to laugh at our auction catalogue
			superlatives in cellar lots?&mdash;to rob a man of his
			boots at times. For my hands&mdash;chipped about
			a bit now&mdash;I used carbolated vaseline. (Do you
			remember the preternaturally slow and wall-eyed
			salesman, with the wart, in the Salisbury shop
			where we bought it?) And then, clothed most
			sumptuously in virginal underwear, I crawled
			into my flea-bag, there to revel from 10.40 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>
			to 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, as I am about to do now, less one hour
			in the morning. How I wish one could consciously
			enjoy the luxury of sleep while sleeping! Good
			night and God bless you! God bless all the sweet,
			brave waiting women of England, and France, and
			Russia; and I wish I could send a bit of my clean
			comfort to-night to as many as may be of our
			good chaps, and France's <i>bon camarades</i>, out here.</p>

		<p>You must forgive my not having sent anything
			but those two Field Service post cards for a whole
			week, but, as our Canadian subaltern, Fosset,
			says, it really has been "some" week. My notion
			was to write you fully my very first impression of
			the trenches, but the chance didn't offer, and
			perhaps it's as well. It couldn't be fresher in
			my mind than it is now, and yet I understand it
			more, and see the thing more intelligently than
			on the first night.</p>

		<p>We are now back in the village of B&mdash;&mdash;, three
			miles from our trenches. We are here for three
			days' alleged rest, and then, as a Battalion, take over
			our own Battalion sub-sector of trenches. So far,
			we have only had forty-eight hours in, as a Battalion;
			though, as individuals, we have had more.
			When we go in again it will be as a Battalion, under
			our own Brigade and Divisional arrangements, to
			hold our own Brigade front, and be relieved later
			by the other two Battalions of our Brigade.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

		<p>"A" Company is, I am sorry to say, in tents for
			these three days out; tents painted to look like
			mud and grass (for the benefit of the Boche airmen)
			and not noticeably more comfortable than
			mud and grass. An old fellow having the extraordinary
			name of Bonaparte Pinchgare, has been
			kind enough to lend us his kitchen and scullery
			for officers' mess and quarters; and we, like the
			men, are contriving to have a pretty good time,
			in despite of chill rain and all-pervading mud.
			We are all more or less caked in mud, but we
			have seen Huns, fired at 'em, been fired at by them,
			spent hours in glaring through rag and tin-decked
			barbed wire at their trenches, and generally feel
			that we have been blooded to trench warfare.
			We have only lost two men, and they will prove
			to be only slightly wounded, I think; one, before
			he had ever set foot in a trench&mdash;little Hinkson
			of my No. 2 section&mdash;and the other, Martin, of
			No. 3 Platoon, only a few hours before we came
			out.</p>

		<p>Hinkson was pipped by a chance bullet in the
			calf of the leg, as we passed through a wood, behind
			the support trench. Very likely a Boche
			loosed that bullet off in mere idleness, a couple of
			thousand yards away; and I doubt if it will mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
			even a Blighty for Hinkson. He may be put right
			in the Field Ambulance or Clearing Station near
			here, or, at farthest, down at the Base. Or he
			may chance to go across to Blighty&mdash;the first
			casualty in the Battalion. The little chap was
			furiously angry over getting knocked out before
			he could spot a Hun through the foresight of his
			rifle, but his mate, Kennedy, has sworn to lay out
			a couple of Boches for Hinkson, before he gets
			back to us, and Kennedy will do it.</p>

		<p>First impressions! Do you know, I think my
			first impression was of the difficulty of finding
			one's way about in a maze of muddy ditches
			which all looked exactly alike, despite a few
			occasional muddy notice-boards perched in odd
			corners: "Princes Street," "Sauchiehall Street,"
			"Manchester Avenue," "Stinking Sap," "Carlisle
			Road," and the like. I had a trench map of the
			sector, but it seemed to me one never could possibly
			identify the different ways, all mud being
			alike, and no trench offering anything but mud to
			remember it by. In the front or fire-trench itself,
			the firing line, one can hop up on the fire-step,
			look round quickly between bullets, and get a
			bearing. But in all these interminable communication
			and branch trenches where one goes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
			and fro, at a depth varying from six to ten or
			twelve feet, seeing only clay and sky, how the
			dickens could one find the way?</p>

		<p>And yet, do you know, so quickly are things
			borne in upon you in this crude, savage life of raw
			realities, so narrow is your world, so vital your
			need of knowing it; so unavoidable is your continuous
			alertness, and so circumscribed the field
			of your occupation, that I feel now I know nothing
			else in the world quite so well and intimately as
			I know that warren of stinking mud: the two sub-sectors
			in which I spent last week. Manchester
			Avenue, Carlisle Road, Princes Street, with all
			their side alleys and boggy by-ways! Why, they
			are so photographed on the lining of my brain that,
			if I were an artist (instead of a very muddy subaltern
			ex-clerk) I could paint the whole thing for
			you&mdash;I wish I could. Not only do I know them,
			but I've merely to shut my eyes to see any and
			every yard of them; I can smell them now; I can
			feel the precise texture of their mud. I know
			their hidden holes and traps, where the water lies
			deep. I know to an inch where the bad breaks
			are in the duck-boards that you can't see because

			Embankment, the Strand, or Brixton Hill!
			That's not an exaggeration.</p>

		<p>Duck-boards, by the way, or duck-walks, are
			a kindly invention (of the R.E., I suspect) to
			save soldiers from the bottomless pit, and to
			enable officers on duty to cover rather more than
			a hundred yards an hour in getting along their
			line of trench. Take two six-or eight-feet lengths
			of two inches by four inches' scantling; nail two
			or three inch bits of batten across these with two
			or three inch gaps between, the width of the frame
			being, say, eighteen inches. Thus you have a
			grating six or eight feet long and narrow enough
			to lie easily in the bottom of a trench. If these
			gratings rest on trestles driven deep down into
			the mud, and your trenches are covered by them
			throughout&mdash;well, then you may thank God for
			all His mercies and proceed to the more interesting
			consideration of strafing Boches, and avoiding
			being strafed by them. If you haven't got these
			beneficent inventions of the R.E., and you are
			in trenches like ours, then you will devote most of
			your energies to strafing the R.E., or some other
			unseen power for good, through your own headquarters,
			for a supply of duck-walks, and you will
			(if you are wise) work night and day without check,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
			in well and truly laying every single length you
			can acquire.</p>

		<p>("Acquire" is a good, sound word. I would
			never blame a man for stealing duck-walks from
			any source whatsoever&mdash;providing, of course, he is
			not so far lost to all sense of decency as to steal
			'em from "A" Company; and even then, if he
			could manage it, his cleverness would almost
			deserve forgiveness; and, equally, of course, that
			he's going to use 'em for their legitimate purpose,
			and not just to squat on in a dug-out; least of all
			for the absolutely criminal purpose of using as
			fuel.)</p>

		<p>"What a fuss you make about mere things to
			walk on!" perhaps you'll say. "I thought the
			one thing really important was getting to grips
			with the enemy." Mmmf! Yes. Quite so. It
			is. But, madam, how to do it? "There be ways
			and means to consider, look you, whateffer,"
			as Billy Morgan says. (Billy was the commander
			of No. 2 Platoon, you remember, and now, as
			reserve Machine-Gun officer, swanks insufferably
			about "the M.G. Section," shoves most of his
			Platoon work upon me, and will have a dug-out
			of his own. We rot him by pretending to attribute
			these things to the influence of his exalted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
			compatriot, the Minister of Munitions. As a fact,
			they are due to his own jolly hard work, and really
			first-rate abilities.)</p>

		<p>This trench warfare isn't by any means the
			simple business you might suppose, and neither,
			of course, is any other kind of warfare. There
			can be no question of just going for the enemy
			bald-headed. He wishes you would, of course;
			just as we wish to goodness <i>he</i> would. You have
			to understand that up there about the front line,
			the surrounding air and country can at any moment
			be converted into a zone of living fire&mdash;gas, projectiles,
			H.E. (High Explosive, you know) flame,
			bullets, bursting shrapnel. If you raise a finger
			out of trenches by daylight, you present Fritz
			with a target, which he will very promptly and
			gratefully take, and blow to smithereens. That's
			understood, isn't it? Right. To be able to fight,
			in any sort of old way at all, you must continue
			to live&mdash;you and your men. To continue to live
			you must have cover. Hence, nothing is more
			important than to make your trenches habitable,
			and feasible; admitting, that is, of fairly easy and
			quick communication.</p>

		<p>To live, you see, you must eat and drink. The
			trenches contain no A B C's. Every crumb of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
			bread, every drop of tea or water, like every cartridge
			you fire, must be carried up from the rear
			on men's shoulders, along many hundreds of yards
			of communicating trenches. Also, in case you
			are suddenly attacked, or have to attack, quick
			movement is vital. Nature apparently abhors
			a trench, which is a kind of a vacuum, and not
			precisely lovable, anyhow; and, in this part of
			the world, she proceeds wherever possible to fill
			it with water. Pumps? Why, certainly. But
			clay and slush sides cave in. Whizz-bangs and
			H.E. descend from on high displacing much porridge-like
			soil. Men hurrying to and fro day and
			night, disturb and mash up much earth in these
			ditches. And, no matter how or why, there is
			mud; mud unspeakable and past all computation.
			Consider it quietly for a moment, and you will
			feel as we do about duck-walks&mdash;I trust the inventor
			has been given a dukedom&mdash;and realise the
			pressing importance of various material details
			leading up to that all-important strafing of
			Boches.</p>

		<p>But there, the notion of trying to tell you about
			trenches in one letter is, I find, hopelessly beyond
			me, and would only exhaust you, even if I could
			bring it off. I can only hope gradually to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
			some sort of a picture into your mind, so that you
			will have a background of sorts for such news of
			our doings as I'm able to send you as we go on.
			Just now, I am going to tackle an alarming stack
			of uncensored letters from Nos. 1 and 2 Platoons&mdash;some
			of the beggars appear to be extraordinarily
			polygamous in the number of girls they write to;
			bless 'em!&mdash;and then to turn in and sleep. My
			goodness, it's a fine thing, sleep, out of trenches!
			But I'll write again, probably to-morrow.</p>

		<p>The men are all remarkably fit and jolly. One
			or two old hands here have told me the line we
			are taking over is really pretty bad. Certainly it
			was a revelation to our fellows, after the beautiful,
			clean tuppenny-tubes of trenches we constructed
			on Salisbury Plain. But one hears no
			grousing at all, except of the definitely humorous
			and rather pleased kind&mdash;rather bucked about it,
			you know&mdash;the men are simply hungry for a
			chance to "get" at the Hun, and they work like
			tigers at trench betterment. We are all well and
			jolly, and even if sometimes you don't hear often,
			there's not the slightest need to worry in any way
			about your</p>

		<p>The second of our rest days is over, and to-morrow
			night we shall go into the firing line and
			relieve the &mdash;&mdash;s. We shall march back the way
			we came out, down the sad-looking green valley
			round the lips of which some of our batteries are
			hidden; through the deserted streets of &mdash;&mdash;,
			with its boarded-up shops and houses; on over
			the weed-grown railway track, through a little
			village whose church is still unbroken; though few
			of its cottage windows have any glass left in them;
			across the busy little river to Ambulance Corner&mdash;a
			favourite target for Boche shells, that bit of
			road&mdash;and so through the wooded hollow where
			the German gas lies deadly thick when it comes,
			into the foot of Manchester Avenue, the long communication
			trench leading up to the Battalion's
			trench headquarters in the support line, where
			"A" Company will branch off to the right, "B"
			to the left, and "C" to the extreme left of our
			sub-sector.</p>

		<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

		<p>That town I mentioned&mdash;not the little village
			close to Ambulance Corner, where most roofs and
			walls show shell-torn rents and a few are smashed
			to dust&mdash;is rather like a city of the dead. It has
			a cathedral which the gentle Hun has ranged on
			with thoughtful frightfulness. But though, under
			the guidance of his aerial observers, the Boche
			has smashed up that cathedral pretty thoroughly,
			and its tower has great gaping chunks riven out
			of its sides by shells, yet, as folk say miraculously,
			its crowning attraction, a monstrous gilt figure
			of the Madonna and Child, thirty to fifty feet
			high, remains intact. But this remarkable gilt
			statue has been undermined at its base by H.E.
			shell, and now hangs over at right angles to the
			street far below it&mdash;a most extraordinary sight.
			The devout naturally claim that no German projectile
			will prove powerful enough to lower the
			sacred emblem any farther. Boche savagery in
			France has not weakened anyone's faith, I think;
			possibly the reverse.</p>

		<p>A foundry or factory near by is now a tangled
			mass of scrap iron, and as one marches through
			the town one has queer intimate glimpses of deserted
			bedroom interiors, with homely furnishings
			exposed to all the weather, where a shell has sliced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
			one wall clean down from a first or second storey
			and left the ground floor intact.</p>

		<p>But I was going to tell you about trenches.
			When I first began to walk up Manchester Avenue,
			my thought was, "There's nothing much to grumble
			at here. I call this pretty good. A little
			sloppy under foot perhaps, but really nothing to
			write home about." I've often laughed at that
			since. For several hundred yards it cuts through
			a ridge of chalk. It is wide enough to enable
			one to pass a man in it anywhere with comfort.
			Its parapet and parados tower white, clean, and
			unbroken a foot or so over your head. Its sides
			are like the sides of a house or a tunnel; good, dry,
			solid chalk, like our Salisbury trenches, with never
			a sign of caving in about them. And on the hard
			bottom under foot-perhaps two or three inches
			of nice clean chalky slime and water. It has a
			gentle gradient which makes it self-draining.</p>

		<p>You could easily go right up it to Battalion
			Headquarters in the support trench in ordinary
			marching boots, and be none the worse. And
			since then I've known what it means to get a
			bootful of muddy water, when wearing trench
			boots; rubber thigh-boots, you know, with straps
			buckling to your belt. The change begins a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
			way above the Battalion Headquarters dug-out,
			in support line. You leave the chalk behind you
			and get into clay, and then you leave the clay behind
			you and get into yellow porridge and treacle.
			And then you come to a nice restful stretch of a
			couple of hundred yards or so, in which you pray
			for more porridge; and it seems you're never
			coming to any more. This is a vein of glue in the
			section which "A" will go to-morrow night.</p>

		<p>"Very old and curious!" "Remarkably fine,
			full body!" Oh! that glue vein is from the end
			bin, genuine old-vatted, I can assure you. It
			must have eaten up some hundreds of pairs of
			boots by now, and a regular Noah's Ark full of
			trench stores, ammunition, and other useful
			material.</p>

		<p>The glue vein probably had a bottom in bygone
			days, but now I fancy the Hun has knocked the
			bottom out of it. In any case, we never met
			anyone who had found bottom in that bit of line,
			and as the tallest man in the company is only six
			foot two, I hope we never shall. At first you
			think you will skip along quick, like skating fast
			on very thin ice, and with feet planted far apart,
			so as to get the support of the trench sides. That
			bit of trench is possessed of devils, and they laugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
			when you stretch your legs, meaning to get
			through with it as quick as you can. The glue's
			so thick and strong, after the soupy stuff you've
			been wading through, that you welcome the solid
			look of it. (That's where the devils begin their
			chuckling.)</p>

		<p>Perhaps at the first few steps you only sink
			about a foot, leaving your knees easily clear.
			"Oh! come!" you say (and that's where the devils
			of the glue patch laugh out loud). At the next
			step you go in a little deeper, and in your innocence
			give quite a sharp tug to lift your foot.
			You lift it all right, perhaps half-way up the leg
			of your boot, possibly ripping off a brace button
			in the process, if you've been unwise enough to
			fasten up the top straps of your boots that way.
			(The devils go on laughing.) Then you pause,
			reflectively, while shoving your foot down in
			your boot again, and take a good look round you,
			wondering what sort of a place you've struck.
			(This is where the devils have to hold their sides
			in almost painful hilarity.)</p>

		<p>While you reflect you sink, so slowly and softly
			that you don't notice it till you try the next step.
			And then, with the devils of that section roaring
			their ugly Hunnish heads off all round you, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
			you have no better luck than Tommy Dodd had,
			his first night in, you may continue reflecting for
			quite a long while, till somebody comes along
			who knows that particular health resort. Then
			two or three Samaritans with picks and shovels
			and a post or two will be brought, and, very laboriously,
			you'll be dug and levered out; possibly
			with your boots, possibly without either them or
			your socks.</p>

		<p>But what reduces the devils to helpless, tearful
			contortions of merriment, is a coincidental
			decision on the part of a Boche gunner to start
			peppering that bit of trench with shrap., or a
			machine-gun, during your reflective period. Then
			it's great; a really first-class opportunity for reviewing
			the errors of your past life.</p>

		<p>After this substantial <i>pièce de résistance</i> (yes,
			thanks, I'm progressing very nicely with my
			French this term), you come to a delicately refreshing
			dessert in Sauchiehall Street, where the
			water lies very deep in most parts, but so sweetly
			liquid as to wash the glue well off up to our coat
			pockets. This innocent stuff can be pumped out
			quite easily, and is pumped out every day, into
			a gully, which we devoutly hope leads well into a
			Boche sap. But pump as you will, it fills up very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
			rapidly. And so, with new washed boots (and
			coat pockets) to Whizz-bang Corner, where
			Sauchiehall Street enters the fire trench, and the
			Hun loves to direct his morning and evening hymns
			of hate in the hope of catching tired ration-carriers,
			and, no doubt, of spilling their rations. It
			was there that Martin of No. 3 Platoon got his
			quietener on the morning we came out. But with
			luck and no septic trouble, hell be back in a month
			or so. The surroundings are a bit toxic, as you
			may imagine. That's why, after even the slightest
			wound, they inoculate with anti-tetanus&mdash;marvellously
			successful stuff.</p>

		<p>The fire trench in this particular bit is rather a
			mockery, as "the Peacemaker" said, when he
			tried to climb out of it, our first night in, to have
			a look at the barbed wire and No Man's Land.
			He had a revolver in one hand and a bomb in
			the other, but I am pleased to say the safety-pin
			of that bomb was efficient; and, in any case, I relieved
			him of it after he fell back the second time.
			The sides of that trench have been so unmercifully
			pounded by the Boche, and the rain has been so
			persistent of late that the porridge here is more
			like gruel than the breakfast dish, and the average
			sand-bag in the parapet, when not submerged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
			is as unfriendly to get a grip on, as one of those
			crustaceous pink bombs they sometimes swindle
			you with at restaurants. You know, the kind
			you chase round your plate and find splinter-proof.</p>

		<p>Thirty or forty yards north from Whizz-bang
			Corner, in the fire trench, you come to a loop turn
			to the rear called Whitehall, not because there's
			a War Office there, but because there's a queer
			little vein of chalk which disappointingly peters
			out again in less than a dozen paces. That leads
			to the Company Headquarters dug-out; an extraordinary
			hole, I thought, when I first saw it; a
			jolly nice, homely dug-out I think it now, and with
			a roof&mdash;well, not shell-proof, you know, but water-tight,
			and quite capable of standing a whizz or
			a grenade, or anything short of serious H.E. You
			stride over a good little dam and then down two
			steps to get into it, and it has a real door, carried
			up, I suppose, from the village in the rear. It also
			has a gilt-edged looking-glass, a good packing-case
			table, the remains of two wooden chairs,
			two shelves made of rum-jar cases, and two good
			solid wire-strung bunks, one over the other.
			There's no doubt it is some dug-out.</p>

		<p>And, madam, don't you go for to think that
			there's anything contemptible about our trenches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
			anyhow. Perhaps I pitched it a bit strong about
			that glue patch. In any case, I promise you two
			things: (1) They'll be very different trenches
			before long if "A" Company has two or three
			turns of duty in them. (2) They're every bit as
			good as, and a bit better than, the trenches opposite,
			where the Hun is; and I know it <i>because I've
				been there</i>. I meant to have told you of that to-night,
			but I've left it too late, and must wait for
			my next letter. But it's quite right. I've had a
			look at their front line and found it distinctly
			worse than ours, and got back without a scratch,
			to sign myself still your</p>

		<p>Last evening brought an end to our rest cure,
			as I told you it would, and saw us taking over
			out section of the firing line. Now I have just
			turned into the Company dug-out for a rest,
			having been pretty much on the hop all night
			except for a short spell between two and four this
			morning. As I think I told you, this is not at all
			a bad dug-out, and quite weather-proof. It has
			two decent bunks one over the other. We all
			use it as a mess, and "the Peacemaker," Taffy
			Morgan, and myself use it for sleeping in; Tony
			and "the Infant" kipping down (when they get
			the chance) in a little tiny dug-out that we made
			ourselves when we were in here for instruction,
			just the other side of Whizz-bang Corner, in the
			fire trench.</p>

		<p>You remember "the Infant," don't you? No.
			4 Platoon. His father's doctoring now in the
			R.A.M.C. He's a nice boy, and has come on a
			lot since we got out here. He was to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
			a land surveyor, or something of that sort, and
			has a first-rate notion of trench work and anything
			like building.</p>

		<p>In writing to you I'd like to avoid, if I could,
			what seems to be a pretty common error among
			men at the front, and one that leads to some
			absurd misapprehensions among people at home.
			I remember listening once in a tram-car at home
			to two Tommies, one of whom had returned from
			the front. The other was asking him how they
			managed in the matter of shifting wounded men
			back to some place where they could be attended
			to.</p>

		<p>"Oh! that's simple enough," said the chap
			who'd been out. "They've a regular routine for
			that. You see, there are always barges waiting,
			and when you're wounded they just dump you
			on board a barge and take you down the canal
			to where the dressing station is."</p>

		<p>"I see; so that's the way it's done," said the
			other man.</p>

		<p>And I could see that the impression left on his
			mind was that barges were in waiting on a canal
			right along the five hundred miles of Franco-British
			line.</p>

		<p>You see what I mean. A fellow out here knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
			only his own tiny bit of front, and he's very apt
			to speak of it as if it were <i>the</i> Front, and folk at
			home are apt to think that whatever is applicable
			to their man's particular mile or so is applicable
			to the whole Front. Which, of course, is wildly
			wrong and misleading. When in trenches one
			battalion may find itself in a wood, another on a
			naked hillside, one in the midst of a ruined village,
			with the cellars of smashed cottages for dug-outs,
			and another with its trenches running alongside
			a river or canal. So don't make the mistake of
			thinking that what I tell you applies to the Front
			generally, although in a great many matters it
			may be typical enough.</p>

		<p>Now you'd like to know about the business of
			taking over these trenches. Well, this was the
			way of it. "The Peacemaker," our noble Company
			Commander, came on here in advance yesterday
			afternoon, with the Company Sergeant-Major.
			Our Company S.M., by the way, is a remarkably
			fine institution, and, I think, the only real ex-regular
			we have in the Company. He's an ex-N.C.O.
			of Marines, and a really splendid fellow,
			who is out now for a V.C., and we all hope he'll
			get it. He and "the Peacemaker" came along
			about three hours ahead of us, leaving me to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
			the Company. "The Peacemaker" went carefully
			all over this line with the O.C. of the Company
			we relieved, noted the sentry posts and special
			danger spots&mdash;unhealthy places, you know, more
			exposed to Boche fire than others&mdash;and generally
			took stock and made his plans for us.</p>

		<p>I forgot to say that a Sergeant from each platoon
			accompanied "the Peacemaker" and the S.M.,
			so as to be able to guide their respective platoons
			in to their own bits of the line when they arrived.
			Then the S.M. checked over all the trench stores&mdash;picks,
			shovels, wire, pumps, small-arm ammunition,
			rockets, mud-scoops, trench repair material,
			and all that&mdash;with the list held by the S.M. of
			the Company we were relieving, which our own
			beloved "Peacemaker," had to sign "certified
			correct," you know. Meantime, "the Peacemaker"
			took over from the other O.C. Company
			a report of work done and to be done&mdash;repairing
			parapets, laying duck-walks, etc.&mdash;though in this
			case I regret to remark the only very noticeable
			thing was the work to be done, or so it seems to us&mdash;and
			generally posted himself up and got all
			the tips he could.</p>

		<p>Just about dusk "A" Company led the way
			out of B&mdash;&mdash;, and marched the way I told you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
			of to Ambulance Corner. Needless to say, they
			presented a fine soldierly appearance, led and
			commanded as they were for the time by your
			"Temporary Gentleman." There was a certain
			liveliness about Ambulance Corner when we
			reached it, as there so frequently is, and I am sorry
			to say poor "B" Company in our rear had two
			men wounded, one fatally. I took "A" Company
			at the double, in single file, with a yard or so between
			men, across the specially exposed bit at
			the corner, and was thankful to see the last of
			'em bolt into the cover of Manchester Avenue
			without a casualty. It gave me some notion
			of the extra anxiety that weighs on the minds of
			O.C. Companies who take their responsibilities
			seriously, as I think most of 'em do.</p>

		<p>Then, when we were getting near Whizz-bang
			Corner, we were met by the four platoon N.C.O.'s
			who had gone on in advance with the Coy. S.M.,
			and they guided the platoons to their respective
			sections of our line. Meantime, you understand,
			not a man of the Company we were relieving had
			left the line. The first step was for us to get our
			platoon Sergeants to post sentries to relieve each
			one of those of the other Company, on the fire-step,
			and we ourselves were on hand with each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
			group, to see that the reliefs thoroughly understood
			the information and instructions they got
			from the men they relieved. Then our advance
			N.C.O.'s showed the other men of their platoons
			such dug-outs as were available for them&mdash;a
			pretty thin lot in this section, but we shall tackle
			the job of increasing and improving 'em as soon
			as we can, while we Platoon Commanders had a
			buck with the Platoon Commanders of the other
			Company.</p>

		<p>Finally, "the Peacemaker" shook hands with
			the O.C. of the Company we relieved outside
			Company Headquarters&mdash;that's this dug-out&mdash;the
			other fellow wished him luck, both of them,
			separately, telephoned down to Battalion Headquarters
			(in the support trenches) reporting the
			completion of the relief, and the last of the other
			Company filed away out down Sauchiehall Street
			to Manchester Avenue, billets and "alleged rest."
			As a matter of fact, they are to get some real
			rest, I believe, another Company of our Brigade
			being billeted in the village just behind the lines
			this week, to do all the carrying fatigues at night&mdash;bringing
			up trench-repair material and all that.</p>

		<p>It was a quiet night, with no particular strafing,
			and that's all to the good, because, in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
			place, it gives us a better chance to study the line
			again by daylight, and, again, it enables us to get
			on quickly with certain very necessary trench
			repairs. We had half the Company working all
			night at the parapet, which had some very bad
			gaps, representing a serious multiplication of
			unhealthy spots, which have to be passed many
			times day and night, and must always be dangerous
			to pass. The Boche is pretty nippy in locating
			gaps of this sort and getting his snipers and machine-gunners
			to range on them, so that unless they are
			repaired casualties are certain. One repairs them
			by building up the gaps with sand-bags, and for
			these it is necessary to find approximately dry
			earth: a pretty difficult job in this section.</p>

		<p>No strafing and a quiet night! I wonder how
			you, and people generally at home, interpret that?
			"The rest of the Front was quiet"; "Nothing
			of interest to report"; "Tactical situation unchanged,"
			and so on. They are the most familiar
			report phrases, of course.</p>

		<p>Well, there was a time last night, or, rather,
			between two and four this morning, when on our
			particular section there was no firing at all beyond
			the dropping rifle fire of the Boche sentries opposite
			and a similar desultory fire from our sentries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
			Now and again a bullet so fired may get a man
			passing along a communication trench, or, more
			likely, of course, a man exposed, either on patrol
			in No Man's Land or in working on the parapet.
			More often they hit nobody. During the same
			time, in our particular section, a flare-light went
			up from the Boche line opposite, I suppose about
			every other minute. That's to give their sentries
			a chance of seeing any patrol we may have creeping
			about in their direction.</p>

		<p>During all the rest of this quiet night of no
			strafing there was just "normal fire." That is to
			say, the Boche machine-guns sprayed our parapet
			and the intervening bit of No Man's Land, maybe,
			once every quarter of an hour. Their rifle fire
			was more continuous; their flares and parachute
			and star-lights the same. Eight or ten times in
			the night they gave us salvoes of a dozen whizz-bangs.
			Twice&mdash;once at about ten, and again
			about twelve&mdash;they gave our right a bit of a
			pounding with H.E., and damaged the parapet a
			little. Once they lobbed four rifle grenades over
			our left from a sap they have on that side. But
			we had been warned about that, and gave 'em
			gyp for it. We had a machine-gun trained on that
			sap-head of theirs, and plastered it pretty effec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>tually,
			so quickly that I think we must have got
			their grenadiers. They shut up very promptly,
			anyhow, and a bombing patrol of ours that got to
			the edge of their sap half an hour later found not
			a creature there to bomb.</p>

		<p>Our fire during the night was similar to theirs,
			but a bit less. "The Peacemaker" has a strong
			prejudice in favour of saving his ammunition for
			use on real live targets, and I think he's right.
			We had one man slightly wounded, and that's all.
			And I think that must be admitted to be pretty
			good, seeing that we were at work along the parapet
			all night. That is a specimen of a really
			quiet night.</p>

		<p>At Stand-to this morning Fritz plastered our
			parapet very thoroughly with his machine-guns,
			evidently thinking we were Johnny Raws. He
			wasted hundreds of rounds of ammunition over
			this. We were all prepared. Not a head showed,
			and my best sniper, Corporal May, got one of
			their machine-gun observers neatly through the
			head. Our lines are only a hundred yards apart
			just there.</p>

		<p>But I must turn in, old thing, or I'll get no rest
			to-day. I know I haven't told you about the
			look I had at the Boche trenches. But perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
			I'll have something better to tell when I next
			write.</p>

		<p>The wonder is, not that I didn't get the one post
			card you mention, but that you apparently have
			had everything I have written. Really, I do
			think the British postal arrangements out here are
			one of the most remarkable features of the war.
			The organisation behind our lines is quite extraordinary.
			Right up here in the firing line itself
			we get our letters and parcels every day. In the
			midst of a considerable bombardment I have seen
			fellows in artillery shelters in the line reading
			letters and opening parcels of little luxuries just
			received from home.</p>

		<p>It's very nice of you to copy out my letters for
			friends at home to read. One simply can't hope
			to write to a number of different people, you know,
			because any spare time going one wants to use
			for sleep. I'm sorry I've omitted to tell you
			about some things I promised to explain, and
			must try to do better.</p>

		<p>As to the time I saw into the Boche trenches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
			while we were in for instruction, that was nothing
			really; due to my own stupidity, as a matter of
			fact, and I dare say that's why I said nothing
			about it. It was our second night in for instruction,
			and the Company we were with was sending
			out a small bombing patrol, so, of course, I asked
			if I could go too, and see what was to be seen.
			The O.C. of the Company very kindly let me
			go, and take with me Corporal Slade, of my
			platoon, an excellent chap, and very keen to
			learn. I wish he could have had a better teacher.</p>

		<p>While close to the Boche wire our little party&mdash;only
			five, all told&mdash;sighted a Boche patrol quite
			twenty strong, and our officer in charge very
			properly gave the word to retire to a flank and
			get back to our own trench, or, rather, to a sap
			leading from it, so as to give warning of the
			Boche patrol. This was where, in my experience,
			I went wrong and led Slade astray. I was very
			curious, of course, to have a good look at the
			Boche patrol&mdash;the first I'd seen of the enemy in
			the open&mdash;and, like a fool, managed to get detached
			from the other three of our lot, Slade
			sticking close to me with a confidence I didn't
			deserve.</p>

		<p>When I realised that the others were clean out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
			of sight, and the Boche party too, I made tracks
			as quickly as I could&mdash;crawling, you know&mdash;as
			I believed for our line, cursing myself for not
			having a compass, a mistake you may be sure I
			shall not make again. Just then a regular firework
			display of flares went up from the Boche
			line, and they opened a hot burst of machine-gun
			fire. We lay as close as we could in the soggy
			grass, Slade and myself, and got no harm. Things
			were lively for a while, with lots of fire from both
			sides, and more light from both sides than was
			comfortable.</p>

		<p>Later, when things had quietened down, we
			got on the move again, and presently, after a
			longish crawl through barbed wire, reached the
			parapet, and were just about to slide in, side by
			side, pretty glad to be back in the trench, when
			a fellow came round the traverse&mdash;we were just
			beside a traverse&mdash;growled something, and jabbed
			at Slade with his bayonet.</p>

		<p>Bit confusing, wasn't it? Makes you think
			pretty quick. I suppose we realised we had struck
			the Boche line instead of our own in something
			under the twentieth part of a second, and what
			followed was too confused for me to remember
			much about. No doubt we both recognised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
			necessity for keeping that chap quiet in the same
			fraction of time that we saw we had reached the
			wrong trenches. I can remember the jolly feeling
			of my two thumbs in his throat. It was jolly,
			really, though I dare say it will seem beastly to
			you. And I suspect Slade did for the chap. We
			were lying on a duck-board at the bottom of the
			trench, and I know my little trench dagger fell
			and made a horrid clatter, which I made sure
			would bring more Boches. But it didn't.</p>

		<p>I am sorry to say I left the little dagger there,
			but I collared the Boche's rifle and bayonet,
			thinking that was the only weapon I had, and
			clean forgetting the two Mills bombs in my pockets.
			Slade was a perfect brick and behaved all through
			like the man he is. We were anxious to make
			tracks without unnecessary delay, but, being
			there, thought we might as well have a look at
			the trench. We crept along two bays without
			hearing or seeing a soul. And then we heard a
			man struggling in deep mud and cursing in fluent
			German. I've thought since, perhaps, we ought
			to have waited for him and tried a bomb on him.
			But at the same time came several other different
			voices, and I whispered to Slade to climb out
			and followed him myself without wasting any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
			time. The trench was a rotten bad one at this
			point, worse, I think, than any of ours. And I
			was thankful for it, because if it had been good
			those Boches would surely have been on us before
			we could get out. As it was, the mud held them,
			and the noises they made grovelling about in it
			prevented them from hearing our movements,
			though we made a good deal of noise, worrying
			through their wire, especially as I was dragging
			that Boche rifle, with bayonet fixed.</p>

		<p>There were glimmering hints of coming daylight
			by the time we got into the open, which made it
			a bit easier to take a bearing, and also pretty
			necessary to have done with it quickly, because
			in another half-hour we should have been a target
			for the whole Boche line. Here again Slade was
			first-rate. He recognised a big shell-hole in the
			ground, which he had noticed was about fifty
			yards north of the head of a sap leading from our
			own line, and that guided us in to the same opening
			in our wire from which we had originally
			started. Fine chap, Slade! Three minutes later
			we were in our own trench, and I got a good tot
			of rum for both of us from the O.C. Company,
			who'd made up his mind he'd have to report us
			"Missing." So, you see, you didn't miss much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
			by not being told all about this before, except an
			instance of carelessness on my part, which might
			have been more costly if I hadn't had a most
			excellent chap with me. "The Peacemaker's"
			going to recommend him for Lance-Sergeant's
			stripes, by the way, when we get out of trenches
			this time.</p>

		<p>You know, that question of yours about what
			it is really "like" here at the front isn't nearly
			so easy to answer as you might suppose. You
			must just be patient. I'll tell you things as I
			learn them and see them, gradually; and, gradually,
			too, you must try to piece 'em together till
			they make some sort of picture for you. If I
			were a real writer I might be able to make it all
			clear in one go, but&mdash;well, it's not easy.</p>

		<p>I've told you about the trenches on the way
			up from Ambulance Corner, the communication
			trenches, that is, running up at right angles to
			the firing line. The chief difference between the
			firing line and the communication trenches, of
			course, is that it faces the Boche front line, running
			roughly parallel to it, and that, say eighteen
			inches above the bottom of it, there is a fire-step
			running along its front side. When you get up
			on that you have a fire position: that is, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
			can see over the parapet, across No Man's Land,
			to the Boche front line, and fire a rifle.</p>

		<p>The lines of trenches are not straight, of course.
			They curve about according to the nature of the
			ground. Running out from them on both sides
			towards the enemy lines there are saps, at the
			end of which we station listening posts at night
			with wired-up telephone and bell connections
			with the firing line. Roughly speaking, a fire
			trench is cut out rather like this:</p>

		<div class="figcenter">
			<a id="trenches" name="trenches"></a>
			<img src="images/trenches.jpg"
					alt="Trenches"
					title="Trenches" />
		</div>

		<p>with traverses every twenty or thirty paces, so
			as to make it impossible for an enemy on your
			flank to get what is called enfilade fire down and
			along the trench. Enfilade fire is deadly, of
			course. Fire from the front, on the other hand,
			if it falls short or overshoots the mark even by
			a yard lands in front of or behind your trench.
			You get that?</p>

		<p>And what does it look like when one stares out
			from one's front trench? Well, it depends. It's
			always pretty queer, but it's queerest at night,
			when the Boche is sending up his ghostly flares,
			or when there's enough moonlight to make you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
			fancy all the time you can see all manner of things.
			First, there's your own parapet, anything from
			five to five-and-twenty feet of it, sloping gradually
			down to the open grass of No Man's Land.
			That's what stops the bullets destined for your
			head. When Boche shells are well enough placed
			to blow it in, you must build it up again as soon
			as you can, or the bit of trench behind it will be
			exposed, and as your men pass to and fro there
			will be casualties.</p>

		<p>Well, then, anything from ten to twenty or
			thirty feet beyond the lip of your trench, your
			wire entanglements begin, and extend, say a good
			thirty or forty paces out into No Man's Land.
			You've seen barbed-wire entanglements in pictures:
			row after row of stakes (some of ours are
			iron screw standards now, that can be set up
			silently) laced together across and across by barbed
			wire, forming an obstacle which it is particularly
			difficult and beastly to get through, especially at
			night, which, of course, is the only time you
			could even approach it without being blown to
			bits.</p>

		<p>Here and there all through our wire are old
			bells, tin cans, bits of flattened tin, and oddments
			of that sort hanging loosely, so that when even a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
			rat begins cavorting about in the wire at night
			your sentries know about it, and the Boche is
			neither so slim nor so agile as a rat. Say that he
			comes by night with bombs in his hand. One
			cannot throw a bomb with any accuracy of aim
			more than twenty or thirty yards. Boche finds
			himself stopped by our wire, say fifty or sixty
			yards from our line. If he slowly worms himself
			in, say twenty paces, without being heard&mdash;and
			he won't&mdash;and lobs a bomb at our line, imagine
			the hail of lead that's coming about him as he
			tries to wriggle his way back through the wire
			after shying his bomb!</p>

		<p>But, as a matter of fact, the Boche is not good
			at that game. He does not shine at all at creep-in
			on our line. When he leaves his trenches at all
			he seems to prefer coming out in pretty close
			formation, rubbing shoulders with his pals. Our
			fellows are a good deal better at sculling about
			over the sticks than he is.</p>

		<p>Here and there in the wire, among the tin cans
			and things, you can see fluttering bits of weather-worn
			uniform and old rags, and, at times, things
			more gruesome. Beyond the wire you see the
			strip of No Man's Land. Where we are, the
			average width of it is round about a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
			yards. In some places it's more, and in one place
			we can see, perhaps a mile off, it narrows down to
			much less than half that. Then begins the Boche
			wire, and through and across that you see the
			Boche front line, very much like your own, too
			much like your own to be very easily distinguished
			from it at night.</p>

		<p>But that's a wonderful thing, that strip we call
			No Man's Land, running from the North Sea to
			Switzerland, five hundred miles. All the way
			along that line, day and night, without a moment's
			cessation, through all these long months, men's
			eyes have been glaring across that forsaken strip,
			and lead has been flying to and fro over it. To
			show yourself in it means death. But I have heard
			a lark trilling over it in the early morning as sweetly
			as any bird ever sang over an English meadow.
			A lane of death, five hundred miles long, strewn
			from end to end with the remains of soldiers!
			And to either side of it, throughout the whole of
			these five hundred miles, a warren of trenches,
			dug-outs, saps, tunnels, underground passages,
			inhabited, not by rabbits, but by millions of
			rats, it's true, and millions of hiving, busy men,
			with countless billions of rounds of death-dealing
			ammunition, and a complex organisation as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
			closely ordered and complete as the organisation
			of any city in England!</p>

		<p>It's also inhabited at this moment by one man
			who simply must stop scribbling, and have some
			grub before going on duty. This one among the
			millions, with the very healthy appetite, manages,
			in despite of all the strafing, to think quite a lot
			about you, and hopes you will go on thinking
			equally cheerily of him&mdash;your</p>

			<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="THE_DUG-OUT" id="THE_DUG-OUT"></a>THE DUG-OUT</h2></div>

			<p>Here's an odd coincidence. The second sentence
				in your letter that reached me last night (with
				our rations of candles and coke) says: "Do
				tell me just what a dug-out is like." You are
				always asking me what something or other is
				"like," which forces upon me the sad conclusion
				that my letters are not in the least descriptive.
				But, "Do not shoot the pianist: he is doing his
				best," and if I had the pen of a readier writer you
				may be sure I'd use it. Yet the odd thing is, with
				regard to this particular command for information,
				I have the pen of a readier writer. You
				know Taffy Morgan&mdash;Billy&mdash;of our Company?
				Well, it seems he's quite a bit of a writer, and
				occasionally sends things home to his father who,
				is trying to keep a consecutive narrative of the
				doings of the Battalion. Now last night, within
				an hour of getting your letter, I read a thing Taffy
				showed me that he was sending home, all about
				a Company Headquarters dug-out in the line:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
				much more decent than my scribbles. So I've
				asked him to let me copy some of it, and here it
				is pat, in answer to your question:</p>

			<p>"'Dug-out' is the only word for it. I don't
				know who did the christening, but it is, like so
				many words and phrases adopted without question
				by Tommy at the front, the one proper, exact,
				and adequate name for the places we inhabit in
				the trenches. The particular dug-out I have in
				mind is a Company Headquarters, situated, like
				a good many others, in a loop trench, perhaps
				seventy to a hundred yards long, which curves
				round at a distance of twenty or thirty yards in
				rear of the fire-trench. The average depth of this
				little back-water of a trench is, say, seven feet.
				It was made by the French before we took over,
				and is very wide at the top. It has no made parapet,
				but is just a gaping ditch, its ragged, receding
				top edges eight or ten feet apart, the lower part,
				in which one walks, being two to three feet wide.
				The bottom of this ditch is duck-walked: that is
				to say, it has wooden gratings six feet long and
				eighteen inches wide laid along it. Each length
				of duck-walk is supported at either end by a
				trestle driven deep down into the mud.</p>

			<p>"Here and there at a bend in the trench there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
				will be a gap of several inches between duck-walks.
				Again one finds a place where one or two slats
				have been broken. These are cheerless pitfalls
				on a dark night, in which it is easy to sink one leg
				in mud or water over the knee. In places a duck-walk
				has canted over by losing its bearings on the
				trestle at one corner, giving the whole a treacherous
				list to one side or the other, simple enough to
				negotiate by day, but unpleasant for anyone hurrying
				along at night. Still, the trench is 'ducked'
				and, so far, luxurious, and a vast improvement on
				the sort of trench (common over the way among
				the Boches, I believe) in which men lose their
				boots, and have to be dug out themselves.</p>

			<p>"It happens that my picture of this Company
				Headquarters dug-out is a three o'clock in the
				morning picture: moonless, and the deadest hour
				of the night, when Brother Boche is pretty generally
				silent, save for a mechanical sort of dropping
				rifle fire: a fire which one knows somehow,
				from its sound, means nothing, unless perhaps it
				means a certain number of German sentries sleepily
				proving to themselves that they are awake. In
				the same desultory fashion, Boche, nearly two
				hundred yards away across the wire entanglements
				and the centre strip of No Man's Land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
				sends up a flare of parachute light every few
				minutes, which, for half a minute, fills our black
				ditch with a queer, ghostly sort of radiance, making
				its dank and jagged sides to gleam again,
				and drawing curses from anyone feeling his way
				along it, even as motor lights in a country lane
				at home make a pedestrian curse on a dark night.</p>

			<p>"As one gropes along this ditch one comes to
				narrow gaps here and there in the side farthest
				from the enemy. These lead to all kinds of odd
				necessary places: the homes of signallers, runners,
				and others, refuse pits, bomb and trench stores,
				and so on. Presently a thin streak of light shows
				like a white string in the blackness. This is one
				of the gaps, about four feet high and eighteen
				inches wide. A dripping waterproof sheet hangs
				as a curtain over this gap: the white string is the
				light from within escaping down one side of the
				sheet. Lift the sheet to one side, take two steps
				down and forward&mdash;the sheet dripping on your
				neck the while&mdash;and you are in the Company
				Headquarters dug-out: a hole dug out of the back
				of the ditch, its floor two feet below the level of
				the duck-boards outside, its internal dimensions
				ten feet by eight by six.</p>

			<p>"At the back of this little cave, facing you as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
				you enter&mdash;and unless you go warily you are apt
				to enter with a rush, landing on the earthen floor
				in a sitting position, what with the wet slime on
				your gum boots and the steps&mdash;are two bunks,
				one above the other, each two feet wide and made
				of wire netting stretched on rough stakes fastened
				to stout poles and covered more or less by a few
				empty sand-bags. One of these is the bunk of
				the O.C. Company, used alternatively by one of
				his subalterns. In the other, a Platoon Commander
				lies now asleep, one gum-booted leg,
				mud-caked well above the knee, dangling over
				the front edge, a goatskin coat over his shoulders,
				his cap jammed hard down over his eyes to shut
				out the light of the candle which, stayed firmly
				to the newspaper tablecloth by a small island of
				its own grease, burns as cheerily as it can in this
				rather draughty spot, sheltered a little from the
				entrance by a screen consisting of a few tins half
				full of condensed milk, butter, sugar, and the like.
				The officer in the bunk is sleeping as though dead,
				and the candle-light catching the mud-flecked
				stubble on his chin suggests that his turn in the
				trenches should be at least half over. Another
				few days should bring him to billets and shaving
				water."</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

			<p>(Here, then, in addition to the description of a
				dug-out, you have a portrait of your "Temporary
				Gentleman," rather unmercifully touched in, I
				thought!)</p>

			<p>"The table&mdash;say, 30 inches by 20 inches&mdash;was
				made from a packing-case, and is perched on
				rough stake legs against the earthen side of the
				dug-out, with a shelf over it which was formerly
				a case holding two jars of rum. On the shelf
				are foodstuffs, Very lights, a couple of rockets, a
				knobkerrie, a copy of <i>Punch</i>, a shortbread tin full
				of candles, a map, an automatic pistol, and, most
				curiously, a dust-encrusted French cookery-book,
				which has taken on the qualities of an antique,
				and become a kind of landlord's fixture among
				'trench stores' in the eyes of the ever-changing
				succession of company commanders who have
				'taken over,' week in and week out, since the
				French occupation in '14.</p>

			<p>"Hung about the sides of the dug-out are half-empty
				canvas packs or valises, field-glasses, a
				couple of periscopes, a Very pistol, two sticks caked
				all over with dry mud, an oilskin coat or two similarly
				varnished over with the all-pervading mud
				of the trench, a steel helmet, a couple of pairs of
				field boots and half a dozen pictures from illus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>trated
				papers, including one clever drawing of a
				grinning cat, having under it the legend, 'Smile,
				damn you!' The field boots are there, and not
				in use, because the weather is of the prevalent sort,
				wet, and the tenants of the place are living in
				what the returns call 'boots, trench, gum, thigh.'
				Overhead is stretched across the low roof tarred
				felt. Above that are rough-hewn logs, then galvanised
				iron and stones and earth: not shell-proof,
				really, but bullet- and splinter-proof, and
				for the most part weather-proof&mdash;at least as much
				so as the average coat sold under that description.</p>

			<p>"The trench outside is very still just now, but
				inside the dug-out there is plenty of movement.
				All round about it, and above and below, the place
				is honeycombed by rats&mdash;brown rats with whitish
				bellies, big as young cats, heavy with good living;
				blundering, happy-go-lucky, fearless brutes, who
				do not bother to hunt the infinitely nimbler mice
				who at this moment are delicately investigating
				the tins of foodstuffs within a few inches of the
				head of the O.C. Company. The rats are variously
				occupied: as to a couple of them, matrons,
				in opposite corners of the roof, very obviously
				in suckling their young, who feed with awful zest;
				as to half a dozen others, in courting, during which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
				process they keep up a curious kind of crooning,
				chirruping song wearisome to human ears; and as
				to the numerous remainder, in conducting a cross-country
				steeplechase of sorts, to and fro and
				round and round on the top side of the roofing
				felt, which their heavy bodies cause to bulge
				and sag till one fancies it must give way.</p>

			<p>"There is a rough rickety stool beside the table.
				On this is seated the O.C. Company, his arms
				outspread on the little ledge of a table, his head
				on his arms, his face resting on the pages of an
				open Army Book 153, in which, half an hour ago,
				he wrote his morning situation report, in order
				that his signallers might inform Battalion Headquarters,
				nearly a mile away down the communication
				trench to the rear, with sundry details, that
				there was nothing doing beyond the normal intermittent
				strafing of a quiet night. The O.C. Company
				is asleep. A mouse is clearing its whiskers
				of condensed milk within two inches of his left ear,
				and the candle is guttering within two inches of
				his cap-peak. During the past few days he has
				had four or five such sleeps as this, half an hour
				or so at a time, and no more, for there has been
				work toward in the line, involving exposure for
				men on the parapet and so forth, of a sort which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
				does not make for restfulness among O.C.
				Companies.</p>

			<p>"There comes a quiet sound of footfalls on the
				greasy duck-boards outside. Two mice on the
				table sit bolt upright to listen. The cross-country
				meeting overhead is temporarily suspended. The
				O.C. Company's oilskin-covered shoulders twitch
				nervously. The mother rats continue noisily
				suckling their young, though one warily pokes its
				sharp nose out over the edge of the felt, sniffing,
				inquiringly. Then the waterproof sheet is drawn
				aside, and the O.C. Company sits up with a jerk.
				A signaller on whose leather jerkin the raindrops
				glisten in the flickering candle-light thrusts head
				and shoulders into the dug-out.</p>

			<p>"'Message from the Adjutant, sir!'</p>

			<p>"The O.C. reads the two-line message, initials
				the top copy for return to the signaller, spikes the
				carbon copy on a nail overhead, where many others
				hang, glances at his wrist-watch, and says wearily:</p>

			<p>"'Well, what are the signallers strafing about,
				anyhow? It's ten minutes before time now.
				Here you are!'</p>

			<p>"He tears two written pages from the Army
				message book which was his pillow, signs them,
				and hands them up to the signaller.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

			<p>"'Call the Sergeant-Major on your way back,
				and tell him I've gone down to the sap-head. He
				can bring the wiring party along right away.
				It's nearly three o'clock. Send a runner to tell
				the officer on duty I'm going out myself with this
				party. You might just remind the Sergeant-Major
				I want two stretcher-bearers at the sap-head.
				Tell 'em to keep out of sight till the
				others are out over the parapet. Right!
				Messages will go to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, of course, while
				I'm out.'</p>

			<p>"Brother Boche may remain quiet. Three
				o'clock is a good quiet time. And there is no
				moon. But, Brother Boche being dead quiet
				just now, may conceivably have patrols out there
				in No Man's Land. They may carry valuable
				information quickly to his line, and two or three
				machine-guns may presently open up on the O.C.
				Company and his wiring party, who, again, may
				be exposed by means of flare lights from the other
				side. One hopes not. Meanwhile, after a glance
				round, the O.C. picks up his mud-caked leather
				mitts, settles the revolver pouch on his belt,
				blows out the guttering candle, feels his way out
				past the dripping waterproof sheet into the black
				trench, and leaves the dug-out to his sleeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
				brother officer (who was on deck from 10 to 1,
				and will be out again an hour before dawn) and
				the rats.</p>

			<p>"Theoretically, this O.C. Company may be
				himself as much in need of sleep as anyone in the
				trench. Actually, however, apart from his needs,
				he is personally responsible for whatever may
				happen in quite a long stretch of dark, mysterious
				trench: of trench which in one moment may be
				converted by the ingenious Boche into a raging
				hell of paralysing gas and smoke, of lurid flame
				and rending explosion. German officers seated
				in artillery dug-outs a mile or so away across the
				far side of No Man's Land may bring about that
				transformation in one moment. They did it less
				than a week ago, though, by reason of unceasing
				watchfulness on this side, it availed them nothing.
				They may be just about to do it now, and, unlike
				the average of German O.C. Companies, our
				officers never ask their men to face any kind of
				danger which they themselves do not face with
				them. And so, for this particular O.C. Company,
				the interior of that queer little dug-out (where the
				men's rum stands in jars under the lower bunk,
				and letters from home are scanned, maps pored
				over, and reports and returns made out) does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
				exactly bring unmixed repose. But the rats love
				it."</p>

			<p>So there you are! By the judicious picking of
				Taffy's brains I have been enabled to present you
				with a much better picture of a dug-out than
				my own unaided pen could give. Reading over,
				there seems something melancholy and sombre
				about it; I don't know why. It's a jolly little
				dug-out, and Taffy's a thundering fine officer;
				nothing in the least melancholy about him.
				Then why&mdash;? Oh, well, I guess it's his Celtic
				blood. Maybe he's got a temperament. I must
				tell him so. By the way, that wiring job he mentions
				came off all right; a nasty exposed place,
				but "the Peacemaker" got his party through
				without a single casualty, or, as the men always
				say, "Casu<i>al</i>ity."</p>

                          <p>Taffy writes a much better letter, doesn't he?

			<p>Very many thanks for the parcel with the horse-hide
				mitts and the torch refills, both of which will
				be greatly appreciated. The mitts are the best
				things of the kind I've seen for trench work, and
				as for electric torches, I don't know what we
				should do without them.</p>

			<p>I've come below for a sleep, really. Taffy Morgan
				was very much off colour yesterday, and is
				far from fit to-day. I had to take his duty as well
				as my own last night, so came off pretty short in
				the matter of rest. But I must stop to tell you
				about the lark we had last night; the jolliest
				thing that's happened since we came in, and no
				end of a score for "A" Company. My batman
				tells me "B" are mad as hatters about it.</p>

			<p>Our signalling officer happened to be along the
				front yesterday afternoon with a brand-new
				telescope that someone had sent the C.O., a very
				fine instrument. Signals wasn't interested in
				our bit of line, as it happens, but was dead nuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
				on some new Boche machine-gun emplacement or
				other away on "B's" left. When he was coming
				back through our line I got him to lend me the
				new glass while he had some tea and wrote reports
				in our dug-out. Perhaps you think there's not
				much need of a telescope when the Boche line is
				less than a couple of hundred yards away. Well,
				now you'd hardly believe how difficult it is to make
				things out. At this time of the year the whole of
				this place is full of mist, for one thing. And then,
				you see, the ground in front is studded all over
				with barbed wire, stakes, long rank grass, things
				thrown out: here and there an old log, and, here
				and there, of course, a dead body. One has to
				look along the ground level, since to look from a
				higher level would mean exposure, and I can assure
				you it's surprisingly easy to miss things. I've
				wasted a good many rounds myself, firing at old
				rags or bits of wood, or an old cape in the grass
				among the Boche wire, feeling sure I'd got a
				sniper. The ground is pretty much torn up, too,
				you understand, by shells and stuff, and that
				makes it more difficult.</p>

			<p>Well, I was looking out from a little sheltered
				spot alongside the entrance to what we call Stinking
				Sap. It has rather a rottener smell than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
				most trenches, I think. And all of a sudden I
				twigged something that waked me right up. It
				was nothing much: just a shovel sticking up against
				a little mound. But it led to other things. A
				yard away from where this shovel lay the C.O.'s
				fine glass enabled me to make out a gap in the wet,
				misty grass. You may be sure I stared jolly
				hard, and presently the whole thing became clear
				to me. The Boches had run out a new sap to
				fully sixty yards from their fire trench, which at
				this particular point is rather far from ours:
				over 250 yards, I suppose. It was right opposite
				our own Stinking Sap, and I suppose the head of
				it was not more than 100 yards from the head of
				Stinking Sap. There was no Boche working there
				then; not a sign of any movement. I made sure
				of that. Then I got my compass and trench map,
				and took a very careful bearing. And then I
				toddled round to Company Headquarters and got
				hold of "the Peacemaker," without letting Signals
				know anything about it. If the O.C. liked to
				let Battalion Headquarters know, that was his
				business.</p>

			<p>Of course, "the Peacemaker" was delighted.
				"It's perfectly clear they must have cut it last
				night," he said. "And as sure as God made little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
				apples, they'll be going on with it to-night. Let's
				see, the moon rises about 9.45. Splendid! They'll
				get to work as soon as it's dark."</p>

			<p>He was awfully decent about it, and agreed to
				let me go, since I'd had the luck to spot it. As a
				matter of fact, he did the more important spotting
				himself. He twigged what I'd overlooked: a
				whacking big shell-hole, shallow but wide, about
				fifteen or twenty feet to one side of their sap-head;
				an absolutely ideal spot for cover, and no more
				than a hundred yards from the head of Stinking
				Sap. I decided to take Corporal Slade with me,
				because he's such a fine bomber, besides being as
				cool as a cucumber and an all-round good chap.
				You remember he was with me that time in Master
				Boche's trench. Somehow, the thing got round
				before tea-time, and the competition among the
				men was something awful. When Slade gave it
				out that I was taking all the men I wanted from
				No. 1 Platoon, there was actually a fight between
				one of my lot and a fellow named Ramsay, of
				No. 3 Platoon; a draper, I'll trouble you, and a
				pillar of his chapel at home. Then a deputation
				of the other Platoon Sergeants waited on "the
				Peacemaker," and in the end, to save bloodshed,
				I agreed to take Corporal Slade and one man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
				from my own Platoon, and one man from each of
				the other three Platoons. To call for volunteers
				for work over the parapet with our lot is perfectly
				hopeless. You must detail your men, or the whole
				blessed Company would swarm out over the sticks
				every time, especially if there's the slightest hint
				of raiding or bombing.</p>

			<p>"The Peacemaker's" idea was that we must
				reach that shell-hole from the end of Stinking
				Sap, if possible, before the Boche started work in
				his new sap, because once he started he'd be sure
				to have a particularly sharp look-out kept, and
				might very well have a covering party outside as
				well. Before it was dark my fellows were champing
				their bits in Stinking Sap, fretting to be off.
				If one gave the beggars half a chance they'd be
				out in the open in broad daylight. But, of course,
				I kept 'em back. There was no reason why
				Boche should be in a violent hurry to start work,
				and I was most anxious he shouldn't suspect that
				we suspected anything.</p>

			<p>As it turned out, we were all lying in that shell-hole
				close to his new sap for three-quarters of an
				hour before a single Boche made a move. There
				was a fine rain all the time, and it was pitch dark.
				The only thing we didn't like was the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
				all the flares and parachute lights ever made seemed
				to be being sent up from the Boche line, right
				alongside this new sap. However, we lay perfectly
				still and flat, hands covered and faces down,
				and as long as you do that all the flares in the
				world won't give you away much, in ground as
				full of oddments and unevenness as that is.</p>

			<p>By and by Slade gave a little tug at my jerkin.
				I listened hard, and just made out footsteps,
				probably in the Boche fire trench itself, near the
				entrance to their new sap. Two or three minutes
				later we began really to enjoy ourselves. As far
				as we could make out Fritz hadn't a notion that
				we were on to his game. Six or eight of 'em came
				shuffling along the sap, carrying picks and shovels,
				and jabbering and growling away nineteen to the
				dozen. We could hear every sound. One fellow,
				anyhow, was smoking. We got the whiff of
				that. We could hear 'em spit, and, very nearly,
				we could hear them breathe. I did wish I knew
				a little more German than "Donnerwetter" and
				"Sprechen Sie Deutsch?"</p>

			<p>I could feel the man on my left (the draper from
				No. 3) quivering like a coursing greyhound in a
				leash, and had to whisper to him to wait for the
				word. But Corporal Slade on my right might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
				have been on the barrack square. I saw him use
				a match to pick his teeth while he listened. I'd
				rehearsed my fellows letter perfect in our own
				trench before we started, and when the Boches
				were fairly under way digging, I gave the signal
				with my left hand. There was a bomb in my
				right. Waiting for it as I was, I could distinctly
				hear the safety-pins come out of our six bombs, and
				could even hear the breathed murmur of the pugnacious
				draper at my shoulder:</p>

			<p>"A hundred an' one, a hundred an' two, a
				hundred an' three!" (He was timing the fuse of
				his bomb, exactly as I'd told 'em.)</p>

			<p>And then we tore a big hole in the night. Our
				six bombs landed, one on the edge and the other
				five plumb in the sap-head before us, right in the
				middle of the six or eight Boches digging there.
				Two seconds after they left our hands they did
				their job. It was less than two seconds really.
				And when the rending row was done we heard
				only one Boche moaning, so I knew that at least
				six or seven were "gone West" for keeps, and
				would strafe no more Englishmen.</p>

			<p>Now the idea had been that directly our job was
				done we should bolt for the head of Stinking Sap.
				But, while we'd been lying there, it had occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
				to me that the Boches, knowing all about what
				distance bombs could be thrown, and that we
				must be lying in the open near their sap-head,
				ought to be able to sweep that ground with machine-gun
				fire before we could get to Stinking Sap, and
				that, having done that, they would surely send a
				whole lot more men down their new sap, to tackle
				what was left of us that way. Therefore I'd made
				each of my fellows carry four bombs in his pockets:
				twenty-four among the lot of us. And we'd only
				used six. Quite enough, too, for the Boches in
				that sap. Therefore, again, we now lay absolutely
				still, and just as close as wax, while Fritz
				rained parachute lights, stars, flares, and every
				kind of firework in the sky, and, just as I had
				fancied, swept his sap-head with at least a thousand
				rounds of machine-gun bullets, not one of
				which so much as grazed us, where we lay spread-eagled
				in the mud of that shell-hole.</p>

			<p>And then&mdash;dead silence.</p>

			<p>"Get your bombs ready, lads," I told my fellows.
				In another few seconds we heard the
				Boches streaming along their narrow new sap.
				They took it for granted we had cleared back to
				our line, and they made no attempt to disguise
				their coming. In fact, from the rate at which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
				they rushed along that narrow ditch I could almost
				swear that some came without rifles or anything.
				We waited till the near end of the sap was
				full, and then: "A hundred and one," etc. We
				gave 'em our second volley, and immediately on
				top of it our third. It must have been a regular
				shambles. Slade and I, by previous arrangement,
				lobbed ours over as far as ever we could to the left,
				landing quite near the beginning of the sap, and
				so getting the Boches who were only just leaving
				their own fire trench. Then I laid my hand on
				the draper to prevent his throwing, and Slade and
				the other three gave their last volley, and bolted
				full pelt for Stinking Sap.</p>

			<p>There was no bucking at all in the part of the
				sap near us. The Boches there wouldn't trouble
				anyone any more, I fancy. But a few seconds
				after Slade disappeared, we heard a fresh lot
				start on their way down the sap from their fire
				trench. We gave 'em up to about "A hundred
				and three" and a half, and then we let 'em have
				our last two bombs, well to the left, and ourselves
				made tracks like greased lightning for Stinking
				Sap. The luck held perfectly, and Slade was
				hauling the draper in over the parapet of Stinking
				Sap before a sound came from the Boches' machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>-guns.
				And then, by Gad! they opened on us.
				They holed my oilskin coat for me, as I slid in
				after Ramsay, and spoiled it. I've jotted it
				down against 'em and in due course they shall pay.
				But not one of my crowd got a scratch, and we
				reckon to have accounted for at the very least
				twenty Boches, maybe double that&mdash;a most
				splendid lark.</p>

			<p>What makes "B" Company rather mad is that,
				strictly speaking, this new Boche sap is a shade
				nearer their line than ours. The C.O. came up
				to look at it this morning, on the strength of
				our O.C.'s morning situation report, and was
				most awfully nice to me about it. He said we did
				well to wait for the Boches' coming down from
				their line after our first scoop, and that plans must
				be made to fit circumstances, and not held to be
				ends in themselves, and all that kind of thing&mdash;initiative,
				you know, and so on&mdash;very nice indeed
				he was. And the best of it is our artillery has
				registered on that sap this morning, and this
				afternoon is just about going to blow it across the
				Rhine. So altogether "A" Company is feeling
				pretty good, if you please, and has its tail well
				up. So has your</p>

</div>

			<p>We are back again in billets, but so close to the
				line this time that it's more like being in support
				trenches. That is to say, one hears all the firing,
				and knows just what is happening in the line all
				the time. Also, we do carrying fatigues in the
				trenches at night. Still, it's billets, and not bad.
				One can get a bath, and one can sleep dry. I
				must tell you about billets sometime. At the
				moment the letter from you lying in front of me
				contains clear orders. I am to tell you what
				patrolling is&mdash;quite a big order.</p>

			<p>Well, there are many different kinds of patrols,
				you know, but so far as we are concerned, here in
				trenches, they boil down to two sorts: observation
				patrols and fighting patrols, such as bombing
				and raiding parties. It's all night work, of course,
				since one cannot do anything over the parapet
				by day without getting shot; anything, that is,
				except a regular attack preceded by bombardment
				of the Boche lines. On the whole, I think it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
				about the most interesting part of our work, and
				I think it's safe to say it's a part in which our
				fellows can run rings round the Boches. In
				masses (well primed with rum; ether and oxygen,
				too, they say) the Boche can do great things. He
				will advance, as it were blindly, in the face of any
				kind of fire you like; even the kind that accounts
				for sixty or seventy per cent. of him in a hundred
				yards. But when he comes to act as an individual,
				or in little groups, as in patrolling&mdash;well, we don't
				think much of him. We think our worst is better
				than his best in all that sort of work. I'm
				perfectly certain that, man for man, the British
				and French troops are more formidable, harder
				to beat, better men all round, than the Boche.</p>

			<p>The first kind of patrol I mentioned&mdash;observation&mdash;is
				part and parcel of our everyday routine
				in the firing line. This kind goes out every night,
				and often several times during the night, from
				every Company. Its main objective is observation:
				to get any information it can about the
				doings of the Hun, and to guard our line against
				surprise moves of any sort. But, though that's
				its main object, it does not go unarmed, of course,
				and, naturally, will not refuse a scrap if the chance
				comes. But it differs from a bombing or raiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
				patrol in that it does not go out for the purpose of
				fighting, and as a rule is not strong, numerically;
				usually not more than about half a dozen in the
				party. In some Companies observation patrols
				are often sent out under a good N.C.O. and no
				officer. We make a point of sending an officer
				always; not that we can't trust our N.C.O.'s;
				they're all right; but we talked it over, and decided
				we would rather one of us always went.
				As I said, it's interesting work, and work with
				possibilities of distinction in it, and we're all pretty
				keen on it. Every Company in the Battalion is.
				(Boche patrols, one gathers, hardly ever include
				an officer.)</p>

			<p>With us, it is decided during the afternoon just
				what we are going to do that night in the patrol
				line, and the officer whose turn it is chooses his
				own men and N.C.O.'s. And within limits, you
				know, "the Peacemaker" lets us work out our
				own plans pretty much as we like, providing there's
				no special thing he wants done. It often happens,
				you see, that during daylight the sentries or the
				officer on duty have been able to make out with
				glasses some signs of work being done at night
				by the Boche, in his front line, or in a sap or a
				communication trench. Then that night it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
				be the job of the patrols to investigate that part
				of the opposite line very carefully. Perhaps half
				a dozen Boches will be found working somewhere
				where our patrol can wipe 'em out by lobbing a
				few bombs among 'em. That's a bit of real jam
				for the patrol. Or, again, they may observe
				something quite big: fifty to a hundred Boches
				carrying material and building an emplacement,
				or something of that kind. Then it will be worth
				while to get back quickly, having got an exact
				bearing on the spot, and warn the O.C. Company.
				He may choose to turn a couple of machine-guns
				loose suddenly on that spot, or he may find it
				better to telephone to Battalion Headquarters
				and let them know about it, so that, if they like,
				they can get our "heavies" turned on, and liven
				the Boche job up with a good shower of H.E.,
				to smash the work, after a few rounds of shrap.
				to lay out the workers.</p>

			<p>Then, again, if you all keep your eyes jolly
				well skinned, there's a sporting chance of getting
				another kind of luck. You may spot a Boche
				patrol while you're crawling about in No Man's
				Land. "B" Company had the luck to do that
				three nights ago, and our fellows are so envious
				now they all want to be patrolling at once; it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
				as much as one can do to keep them in the trench.
				They're simply aching to catch a Boche patrol
				out, and put the wind up "B." You see "B"
				lost two out of a Boche patrol of six; killing three
				and taking one prisoner. "A" can't say anything
				about it, of course, because we've not had the
				luck yet to see a Boche patrol. But God help its
				members when we do, for I assure you our fellows
				would rather die half a dozen times over than fail
				to wipe "B's" eye. It's the way they happen to
				be built. They don't wish the Boche any particular
				harm, but if they can get within sight of a
				Boche patrol, that patrol has just got to be scuppered
				without any possible chance of a couple
				getting clear. The performance of "B" has just
				got to be beaten, and soon.</p>

			<p>Honestly, it isn't easy to hold these chaps back.
				The observation patrol I was out with the night
				before we came out of the trenches really needed
				holding. There were no Boche patrols for them
				to scupper, and just to humour the beggars I kept
				'em out nearly an hour longer than I had any right
				to; and then, if you'll believe me, they were so
				disappointed at having to head back with nothing
				in the bag, so to say, that the Corporal was deputed
				to beg my permission for a little raid on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
				Huns' front trench. And there were just five of
				us, all told; our only weapons knobkerries and
				two bombs each, and my revolver and dagger.</p>

			<p>By the way, the survivor of the Hun patrol that
				"B" rounded up was not the first prisoner taken
				by the Battalion. No; we had that honour nearly
				a week ago. A queer episode that, on our second
				night in. There was a bit of line on our extreme
				right which was neither for use nor ornament; a
				horrible place. It had been all blown in by trench
				mortars and oil-cans, and hardly had a strand of
				unbroken wire in front of it. (You may be sure
				it's in different shape now. We worked at it for
				two nights in succession, and made a good job
				of it.) Well, it was so bad for fifty yards or so
				that sentries could not occupy it properly; no
				fire-step left, and no cover worth speaking of.
				Taffy Morgan was nosing about in front of this
				bit just after dark, out beyond where the wire had
				been, marking places for new entanglements,
				when he spotted a big Boche patrol making slowly
				up that way from their front. They were fifteen
				or twenty strong.</p>

			<p>Taffy lay very low, and crawled back into our
				line without being seen. Then he raced down the
				trench for his pet machine-gun&mdash;a Lewis, you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>&mdash;and
				got it along there with a Corporal and a
				couple of machine-gunners in rather less than no
				time. By then the messenger he had sent off
				had got back with "the Peacemaker" and myself
				and the Sergeant-Major. We all kept as quiet
				as mice till we were able to make out the movement
				of the Boche patrol. We let them get fairly
				close&mdash;thirty or forty yards&mdash;and then let blaze
				at 'em, firing just as low as we could.</p>

			<p>I suppose we gave 'em about four hundred
				rounds. We heard a bit of moaning after "the
				Peacemaker" gave the word to cease fire, and then,
				to our amazement, a Hun talking, apparently to
				another Boche, telling him to come on, and calling
				him some kind of a bad hat. I tell you, it
				was queer to listen to. The Boche who was doing
				the talking appeared to have worked a good bit
				down to the left of the bunch we had fired at,
				and had evidently got into our wire. We could
				hear him floundering among the tin cans.</p>

			<p>"Don't fire," said "the Peacemaker." "We'll
				maybe get this chap alive." And, sure enough,
				the Boche began singing out to us now, asking
				first of all whether we were Prussian, and then
				trying a few phrases in French, including a continuously
				repeated: "Je suis fatigué!"</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

			<p>Most extraordinary it was. "The Peacemaker"
				couldn't tell him we were Prussian, but he kept
				inviting the fellow to come in, and telling him we
				wouldn't hurt him. Finally I took a man out
				and lugged the chap in out of the wire myself.
				We got tired of his floundering, and I guess he
				must have been tired of it too, for he was pretty
				badly cut by it. He had no rifle; nothing but a
				dagger; and the moment I got him into our trench
				he began catting all over the place; most deadly
				sick he was.</p>

			<p>We led him off down the trench to the S.M.'s
				dug-out and gave him a drink of tea, and washed
				the wire cuts on his face and hands. He was a
				poor starveling-looking kind of a chap; a bank
				clerk from Heidelberg, as it turned out afterwards,
				and a Corporal. He told us he'd had nothing
				but rum, but we thought him under the influence
				of some drug; some more potent form of Dutch
				courage, such as the Huns use before leaving
				their trenches. Our M.O. told us afterwards he
				was very poorly nourished. We blindfolded him
				and took him down to Battalion Headquarters,
				and from there he would be sent on to the Brigade.
				We never knew if they got any useful information
				out of him; but he was the Battalion's first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
				prisoner. The other Boches we got in that night
				were dead. That burst of M.G. fire had laid them
				out pretty thoroughly, nine of 'em; and a small
				patrol we kept out there wounded three or four
				more who came much later&mdash;I suppose to look
				for their own wounded.</p>

			<p>There's a creepy kind of excitement about
				patrol work which makes it fascinating. If there's
				any light at all, you never know who's drawing
				a bead on you. If there's no light, you never
				know what you're going to bump into at the next
				step. It's very largely hands-and-knees' work,
				and our chaps just revel in it. My first, as you
				know, landed me in the Boche trenches; and
				that's by no means a very uncommon thing either,
				though it ought never to happen if you have a
				good luminous-faced compass and the sense to
				refer to it often enough. My second patrol was
				a bit more successful. I'll tell you about that
				next time. Meanwhile, I hope what I've said
				will make you fancy you know roughly what
				patrol work is, though, to be sure, I feel I haven't
				given you the real thing the way Taffy could if
				he set out to write about it. He could write it
				almost better perhaps than he could do it. He's
				a wee bit too jerky and impulsive, too much strung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
				up rather, for patrol work. My thick-headed
				sort of plodding is all right on patrol; suits the
				men first-rate. I suppose it kind of checks the
				excitement and keeps it within bounds. But you
				mark my words, our fellows will get a Boche patrol
				before long, and when they do I'll wager they
				won't lose any of 'em.</p>

			<p>We're going to play a team of "B" Company at
				football to-morrow afternoon, if the Boche
				doesn't happen to be running an artillery strafe.
				We play alongside the cemetery, and for some
				unknown reason the Boche gunners seem to be
				everlastingly ranging on it, as though they wanted
				to keep our dead from resting. We're all as fit
				and jolly as can be, especially your</p>

			<p>Here in billets the amount of letter-writing
				the men do is something appalling&mdash;for the officers
				who have to censor their letters. As you know,
				our training in England included some time in
				four different parts of the country, and our fellows
				have sweethearts in each place. And they
				seem to get parcels from most of 'em, too. Then
				there are the home letters. They all describe
				their writers as being "in the pink," and getting
				on "champion," as, I believe, I told you before.</p>

			<p>My billet&mdash;or, rather, our billet, for all "A"
				Company officers are under the one roof here&mdash;is
				in the church house, and there's a candlestick
				three feet high in the bedroom I share with Taffy.
				There's no glass in the windows, and the roof at
				one end has had a shell through it, and so the
				room gets a bit swampy. Otherwise, the place is
				all right. Our own batteries near by shake it up
				at times, and the shell-holes, in the road outside
				show it's had some very narrow squeaks; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
				neither it nor the church has suffered very much,
				though they stand well up on a hill, less than half
				a mile from our support line of trenches, which
				the Battalion billeted here mans in event of alarm&mdash;gas
				attack, you know, or anything of that sort.
				So while we're here we sleep fully equipped at
				night. But in our next week out, at the village
				farther back, we are more luxurious, and undress
				of a night.</p>

			<p>But I promised to tell you about that second
				patrol of mine. We were greatly interested in
				some kind of an erection we could see just behind
				the Boche front line on our left. All we could
				see was sand-bags; but, somehow, it looked too
				big and massive for a mere machine-gun emplacement,
				and we were all most anxious to find out
				what it could be. So "the Peacemaker" agreed
				that I should take a patrol that night and try to
				investigate. This was the first patrol we sent out
				as a Company in the line on our own. My first
				was when we were in with another Company for
				instruction, you know, and they apparently had
				not noticed this sand-bag structure. At all
				events, they made no report to "the Peacemaker"
				about it when we took over.</p>

			<p>The moon was not due to rise till about eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
				that night, so I decided to go out at nine. The
				Company Sergeant-Major asked if he could come,
				so I arranged to take him and one Platoon scout
				from each Platoon. They had none of them been
				out as yet, and we wanted them to have practice.
				Getting out into No Man's Land marks a distinct
				epoch in a man's training for trench warfare, you
				know. If it happens that he has some considerable
				time in trenches without ever going over the
				parapet, he's apt to be jumpy when he does get
				out. I fancy that must be one reason why the
				Boches make such a poor show in the matter of
				individual effort of an aggressive sort. They're
				so trench-bound that their men seem no use out
				of trenches, except in massed formation.</p>

			<p>Don't make any mistake about it; there's
				some excuse for a man being jumpy over the
				parapet when he's never had a chance of getting
				accustomed to it. That's why I think our O.C.
				is very wise in the way he tries to give all the men
				a turn at work over the parapet, wiring, patrolling,
				improving saps, and what not: because it's a
				pretty eerie business until you get used to it.
				Behind our line you have graves and crosses, and
				comparatively friendly things of all kinds&mdash;rubbish,
				you know, and oddments discarded by fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
				humans no longer ago than a matter of hours.
				But out in No Man's Land, of course, the dominant
				factor is the swift, death-dealing bullet,
				and the endless mass of barbed-wire entanglements
				which divides Boches from Britons and
				Frenchmen for so many hundreds of miles. There
				are plenty of dead things out there, but, barring
				the rats, when you get any other movement in
				No Man's Land you may reckon it's enemy
				movement: creeping men with bombs and daggers,
				who may have been stalking you or may not have
				seen you. But it wouldn't do to reckon much
				on anyone's not having seen you, because if
				there's one place in the world in which every
				man's ears and eyes are apt to be jolly well open
				it's out there in the slimy darkness of No Man's
				Land.</p>

			<p>You may very well chance to stick your hand
				in the upturned face of a far-gone corpse, as I
				did my first time out; but if you do so you
				mustn't shiver&mdash;far less grunt&mdash;because shivering
				may make your oilskin coat or something else
				rustle, and draw fire on you and your party. So
				a man needs to have his wits about him when he's
				over the parapet, and the cooler he keeps and the
				more deliberate are his movements the better for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
				all concerned. One needn't loaf, but, on the
				other hand, it's rather fatal to hurry, and quite
				fatal to flurry, especially when you're crawling
				among wire with loose strands of it and "giant
				gooseberries" of the prickly stuff lying round in
				all directions on the ground to catch your hands
				and knees and hold you up. If you lose your
				head or do anything to attract attention, your
				number's pretty well up. But, on the other
				hand, if you keep perfectly cool and steady, making
				no sound whatever happens, and lying perfectly
				flat and still while Boche flares are up or
				their machine-guns are trying to locate you, it's
				surprising how very difficult it is for the Hun to
				get you, and what an excellent chance you have
				of returning to your own line with a whole skin.</p>

			<p>I had an exact compass bearing on the spot we
				wanted to investigate, taken from the sap on our
				left from which we were starting. "The Peacemaker"
				ran his own hands over the men of the
				party before we climbed out, to make sure everyone
				had remembered to leave all papers and things
				of that sort behind. (One goes pretty well stripped
				for these jobs, to avoid anything useful falling
				perchance into Boche hands.) We each carried
				a couple of bombs, the men had knobkerries, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
				I had revolver and dagger, to be on the safe side.
				But we were out for information, not scrapping.</p>

			<p>It was beautifully dark, and, starting from a
				sap-head, clear of our own wire, we crossed the
				open very quickly, hardly so much as stooping,
				till we were close to the Boche wire, when a
				burst of machine-gun fire from them sent us to
				ground. The Companies on each flank in our
				line had been warned we were out. This is
				always done to prevent our own men firing at
				us. Such little fire as was coming from our
				line was high, and destined for the Boche
				support lines and communications; nothing to
				hurt us.</p>

			<p>Now, when we began crawling through the
				Boche wire I made the sort of mistake one does
				make until experience teaches. I occupied myself
				far too much with what was under my nose, and
				too little with what lay ahead&mdash;and too little
				with my compass. To be sure, there's a good deal
				in the Boche wire which rather forces itself upon
				the attention of a man creeping through it on
				hands and knees. The gooseberries and loose
				strands are the devil. Still, it is essential to keep
				an eye on the compass, and to look ahead, as well
				as on the ground under one's nose, lest you over-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>shoot
				your mark or drop off diagonally to one side
				or the other of it. I know a good deal better now.
				But one has no business to make even one mistake,
				if one's a "Temporary Officer and Gentleman,"
				because one's men have been taught to
				follow and trust one absolutely, and it's hardly
				ever only one's own safety that's at stake.</p>

			<p>Suddenly I ran my face against the side of
				a "giant gooseberry" with peculiarly virulent
				prongs, and in that moment a bullet whizzed low
				over my head, and&mdash;here's the point&mdash;the bolt
				of the rifle from which that bullet came was pulled
				back and jammed home for the next shot&mdash;as it
				seemed right in my ear. We all lay perfectly flat
				and still. I could feel the Sergeant-Major's
				elbow just touching my left hip. Very slowly
				and quietly I raised my head enough to look round
				the side of that "giant gooseberry," and instinct
				made me look over my right shoulder.</p>

			<p>We were less than ten paces from the Boche
				parapet. The great, jagged black parados, like
				a mountain range on a theatre drop scene, hung
				right over my shoulder against a sky which seemed
				now to have a most deadly amount of light in it.
				I was lying almost in a line with it, instead of at
				right angles to it. Just then, the sentry who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
				fired gave a little cough to clear his throat. It
				seemed he was actually with us. Then he fired
				again. I wondered if he had a bead on the back
				of my head. He was not directly opposite us,
				but a dozen paces or so along the line.</p>

			<p>Now, by the queer twisty feeling that went
				down my spine when my eyes first lighted on that
				grim black line of parados just over my shoulder,
				I guessed how my men might be feeling. "Little
				blame to them if they show some panic," thinks
				I. I turned my face left, so as to look down
				at the Sergeant-Major's over my left shoulder.
				He'd seen that towering parados against the sky,
				and heard that sentry's cough and the jamming
				home of his rifle bolt. By twisting my head I
				brought my face close to the S.M.'s, and could
				see that he fancied himself looking right into his
				own end. I had to think quick. I know that
				man's mind like the palm of my hand, and I
				now know his splendid type: the English ex-N.C.O.
				of Marines, with later service in the Metropolitan
				Police&mdash;a magnificent blend. I also know the
				wonderful strength of his influence over the men,
				to whom he is experienced military professionalism,
				expertness incarnate. At present he felt we
				had come upon disaster.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

			<p>"My Gawd, sir!" he breathed at me. "Why,
				we're on top of 'em!"</p>

			<p>That was where I thought quick, and did a
				broad grin as I whispered to him: "Pretty good
				for a start&mdash;a damn fine place, Sergeant-Major.
				But we'll manage to get a bit nearer before we
				leave 'em, won't we?"</p>

			<p>It worked like a charm, and I thanked God for
				the fine type he represents. It was as though his
				mind was all lighted up, and I could see the thoughts
				at work in it. "Oh, come! so it's all right, after
				all. My officer's quite pleased. He knew all
				about it and it's just what he wanted; so that's
				all right." These were the thoughts. And from
				that moment the S.M. began to regard the whole
				thing as a rather creditable lark, though the pit
				of his stomach had felt queer, as well it might, for
				a moment. And the wonderful thing was&mdash;there
				must be something in telepathy, you know&mdash;that
				this change seemed to communicate itself
				almost instantly to the men&mdash;bless their simple
				souls!&mdash;crouched round about behind. I'd no
				time to think of the grimness of it, after that. A
				kind of heat seemed to spread all over me from
				inside, and I had been cold. I think a mother
				must feel like that when danger threatens her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
				kiddies. The thought in my mind was: "I've
				brought these fellows here in carelessness. I'll
				get 'em back with whole skins or I'll die at it."</p>

			<p>I never had any Hymn of Hate feeling in my
				life, but I think I'd have torn half a dozen Boches
				in pieces with my hands before I'd have let 'em
				get at any of those chaps of mine that night.</p>

			<p>Now I was free; I knew the men were all right.
				I whispered to the S.M., and very slowly and
				silently we began to back away from that grim
				parados. The sentry must have been half asleep,
				I fancy. My compass showed me we must be
				forty or fifty yards left of the point in the Boche
				line we wanted; so as soon as we were far enough
				back we worked slowly up right, and then a bit
				in again. And then we found all we'd hoped for.
				It was a regular redoubt the Boche was building,
				and he had nearly a hundred men at work, including
				the long string we saw carrying planks
				and posts. Some were just sitting round smoking.
				We could hear every word spoken, almost every
				breath. And we could see there were sixty or
				seventy men immediately round the redoubt.</p>

			<p>That was good enough for me. All I wanted
				now was to get my men back safely. I knew
				"the Peacemaker" had two machine-guns trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
				precisely on the redoubt. All I wanted was to
				make sure their fire was all a shade to the left,
				and every bullet would tell. We should be firing
				fairly into the brown of 'em; because the little
				cross communication trench which we had watched
				them working in was no more than waist-deep;
				just a short-cut for convenience in night work
				only. We had 'em absolutely cold. The S.M.
				told me the men wanted to bomb 'em from where
				we were. But that was not my game at all.</p>

			<p>With the compass bearing I had, getting back
				was simple. I saw the last man into our sap, and
				found the O.C. waiting there for me. I'd no
				sooner given him my news than he was at the
				guns. We had twenty or thirty rifles levelled on
				the same mark, too, and, at "the Peacemaker's"
				signal, they all spoke at once. Gad! it was fine
				to see the fire spouting from the M.G.'s mouth,
				and to know how its thunder must be telling.</p>

			<p>Four belts we gave 'em altogether, and then
				whipped the guns down into cover, just as the
				Boche machine-guns began to answer from all
				along their line. It was a "great do," as the
				S.M. said. The men were wildly delighted.
				They had seen the target; lain and watched it,
				under orders not to make a sound. And now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
				the pressure was off. Listening now, the Boche
				guns having ceased fire, our sentries could plainly
				hear groaning and moaning opposite, and see the
				lights reflected on the Boche parados moving to
				and fro as their stretcher-bearers went about
				their work. A "great do," indeed. And so
				says your</p>

				into their different billets the C.S.M. proceeded
				to post our Company guard outside Company
				Headquarters. He had just given the sentry
				his instructions and turned away, when Boche
				broke out in a fresh place&mdash;their battery commander's
				evening sauerkraut had disagreed with
				him, or something&mdash;and half a dozen shells came
				whistling over the village in quick succession.
				One landed in the roadway, a yard and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
				in front of the newly-posted sentry. Had it been
				a sound shell, it would have "sent him West";
				but it proved a dud, and merely dug itself a neat
				hole in the macadam and lay there like a little
				man, having first sent a spray of mud and a few
				bits of flint spurting over our sentry and rattling
				against his box.</p>

			<p>Now that sentry happened to be our friend
				Tommy Dodd; and Tommy was about tired out.
				He'd been on a wiring party over the parapet
				three parts of the night, taken his turn of sentry-go
				in the other part; and all day long had been
				digging and mud-scooping, like the little hero he
				is, to finish repairing an impassable bit of trench
				that master Boche had blown in the evening before,
				to make it safe before we handed over to the
				Company relieving. He was literally caked in
				clay from head to foot; eyebrows, moustache,
				and all; he hadn't a dry stitch on him, and, of
				course, had not had his supper. It was an oversight
				that he should have been detailed for first
				sentry-go on our arrival in billets. I had noticed
				him marching up from the trenches; he could
				hardly drag one foot after another. What do
				you think the shell landing at his feet and
				showering mud on him extorted from weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
				Tommy Dodd? I was standing alongside at the
				time.</p>

			<p>"'Ere, not so much of it, Mister Boche! You
				take it from me an' be a bit more careful like.
				Silly blighter! Wotjer playin' at? Didn't yer
				know I was on sentry? Chuckin' yer silly shells
				about like that! If yer ain't more careful you'll
				be dirty'n me nice clean uniform nex', an' gettin'
				me paraded over for bein' dirty on sentry-go!"</p>

			<p>It's a pretty good spirit, isn't it? And I can
				assure you it runs right through; warranted fast
				colour; and as for standing the wash&mdash;well,
				Tommy Dodd had been up to his middle in muddy
				water most of the day. The Kaiser may have a
				pretty big military organisation, but, believe me,
				Germany and Austria together don't contain
				anything strong enough to dull, let alone break
				the spirit of the men of the New Army. The
				Army's new enough; but the tradition and the
				spirit are from the same old bin. It isn't altered;
				and there's nothing better; not anywhere in the
				world.</p>

			<p>And I'm supposed to be telling you about billets!</p>

			<p>Well, I told you before, how we took over from
				another Company; and the same holds good of
				how the other Company takes over from us in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
				trenches; and when it's over our fellows file out
				down the long communication trench, by platoons,
				with a goodish interval between men, so as to
				minimise the effect of chance bullets and shells;
				every man carrying all his own mud-caked goods
				and chattels, and all in good spirits at the prospects
				of a little change. Nothing Tommy welcomes so
				much as change&mdash;unless it's the chance of a
				scrap.</p>

			<p>We cannot very well form up and march properly
				directly we get out of trenches at Ambulance
				Corner, because Fritz is so fond of directing his
				field-gun practice there; so we rather straggle over
				the next quarter of a mile, by platoons, till we
				come to the little river. It's a jolly little stream,
				with a regular mill-race of a current, and a nice
				clear shallow reach close to the bridge, with clean
				grass alongside. We wade right in and wash
				boots. Everyone is wearing "boots, trench, gum,
				thigh," so he just steps into the river and washes
				the mud off. Then he gets back to the bank, and
				off with the gum-boots and on with the ordinary
				marching boots, which have been carried slung
				round the neck by their laces. The trench boots,
				clean and shiny now, are handed into store at
				Brigade Headquarters, ready for our next turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
				in, for anyone else who wants 'em. In store,
				they are hung up to dry, you know, for, though
				no wet from outside will ever leak into these
				boots (unless they're cut), yet, being water-and
				air-tight, they get pretty wet inside after a week's
				turn in trenches, from condensation and the
				moisture of one's own limbs which has no chance
				of evaporation. It's the same with the much-vaunted
				trench-coats, of course; a few hours'
				wear makes 'em pretty damp inside.</p>

			<p>After handing in the boots, we form up properly
				for marching into the village. Our Company
				Quartermaster-Sergeant, with a N.C.O. from each
				platoon, has been ahead a few hours before us,
				to take over billets from the Q.M.S. of the Company
				that relieved us; and so each platoon has a
				guide to meet it, just as in taking over a line of
				trenches. Either in or close to every billet, there
				are cellars marked up outside for so many men.
				These are our bolt-holes, to which every man is
				instructed to run and take shelter the instant a
				bombardment begins. "Abri 50 hommes"; or
				"Cellar for 30 men"; these are the legends you
				see daubed outside the cellars. And chalked on
				the gates of the house-yards throughout the village
				you will see such lines as "30 Men, 'A' Coy.";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
				or "2 Off.'s, 30 Men, 'B' Coy."; and, perhaps,
				the initials of the regiment.</p>

			<p>But when I mention billets you mustn't think
				of the style in which you billeted those four
				recruits last spring, you know. By Jove, no!
				It is laid down that billets in France mean the
				provision of shelter from the elements. Sometimes
				it's complete shelter, and sometimes it isn't;
				but it's always the best the folk can give. In
				this village, for instance, there are hardly any
				inhabitants left. Ninety per cent. of the houses
				are empty, and a good many have been pretty
				badly knocked about by shells. I have often
				laughed in remembering your careful anxiety
				about providing ash-trays and comfortable chairs
				for your recruits last year; and the trouble you
				took about cocoa last thing at night, and having
				the evening meal really hot, even though the
				times of arrival with your lodgers might be a bit
				irregular. It's not <i>quite</i> like that behind the firing
				line, you know.</p>

			<p>In some places the men's billets are all barns,
				granaries, sheds and stables, cow-houses, and the
				like. Here, they are nearly all rooms in empty
				houses. As for their condition, that, like our
				cocoa of a night, and cooking generally, is our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
				affair. In our Division, discipline is very strict
				about billets. They are carefully inspected once
				or twice during each turnout by the Commanding
				Officer, and every day by the O.C. Company and
				the Platoon Commanders. We have no brooms,
				brushes, or dusters, except what we can make.
				But the billets have to be very carefully cleaned
				out twice a day, and there must be no dirt or
				crumbs or dust about when they are inspected.
				Even the mire of the yards outside has to be
				scraped and cleared away, and kept clear; and
				any kind of destruction, like breaking down doors
				or anything of that sort, is a serious crime, to
				be dealt with very severely. The men thoroughly
				understand all this now, and the reason of it;
				and they are awfully good. They leave every
				place cleaner and better than they found it.</p>

			<p>In the same way it has been strictly laid down
				that in their attitude towards the inhabitants the
				men must be scrupulous. And, by Jove, they
				are! Wherever our troops are you will find men
				in khaki helping the women with their washing,
				drawing water, feeding stock, bringing in cows,
				getting in wood, and all such matters; and if our
				fellows haven't much French, I can assure you
				they are chattering in some sort of a language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
				most of the time. And if all this is incomprehensible
				to the good Frenchwomen, how is it that the
				latter respond with so lively a chatter, and why
				are they always smiling and laughing the while&mdash;even
				when one sees that in their eyes which
				tells more plainly than the mourning they wear
				of sacrifices they have made in the service of
				France? Come to think of it, do you know, that
				sums up the attitude of all the French women I
				have met, and of the old men of France, too;
				and it's an attitude which compels respect, while
				it elicits sympathy. They smile with their lips,
				and in the brave hearts of them they smile, too;
				even though they cannot altogether hide either
				the wearing anxiety of waiting, or, where bereavement
				has come, the grief of mourning for brave
				men lost, which shows in their eyes.</p>

			<p>In the first convenient archway handy to our
				billets you will find the Company's field cooker.
				You have seen them trailing across the Plain down
				Salisbury way on field days&mdash;the same old cookers.
				The rations come there each day, from the
				Battalion Q.M. store, three miles away; and
				there the men draw them in their cooked form at
				meal-times. In every village there is a canteen
				where men buy stuff like chocolate, condensed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
				milk, tinned café-au-lait, biscuits, cake, and so
				forth.</p>

			<p>In the day-time, when there are no carrying
				fatigues, we have frequent inspections, and once
				the first day out of trenches is past, every man's
				equipment has to be just so, and himself clean-shaven
				and smart. We have a bath-house down
				near the river, where everyone soaks in huge
				tubs of hot water; and in the yard of every
				billet you will find socks, shirts, and the like
				hanging out to dry after washing. By 8.30 at
				night all men not engaged in carrying fatigues
				have turned in. During the week out of trenches
				we get all the sleep we can. There are football
				matches most afternoons, and sing-songs in the
				early evenings. And all and every one of these
				things are subject to one other thing&mdash;strafe;
				which, according to its nature, may send us to our
				cellars, or to the manning of support trenches and
				bridge-head defences.</p>

			<p>With regard to the officers, our batmen cook our
				grub, moderately well or atrociously badly, according
				to their capacity. But, gradually, they
				are all acquiring the soldierly faculty of knocking
				together a decent meal out of any rough elements
				of food there may be available. More often than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
				not we do quite well. Our days are pretty much
				filled up in looking after the men, and in the
				evenings, after supper, we have their letters to
				censor, our own to write, if we are energetic
				enough, and a yarn and a smoke round whatever
				fire there may be before turning in; after which
				the Boche artillery is powerless to keep us awake.
				At this present moment I doubt whether there's
				another soul in "A" Company, besides myself,
				who's awake, except the sentry outside headquarters.
				And I shall be asleep in about as
				long as it takes me to sign myself your</p>

			<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="BOMBARDMENT" id="BOMBARDMENT"></a>BOMBARDMENT</h2></div>

			<p>The day before we came back into trenches I
				meant to have written you, but the chance didn't
				arise. Now we have been in just twenty-four
				hours, and though the time has gone like lightning,
				because one has been on the jump all the while,
				yet, looking back, it seems ever so long since we
				were in billets. A good deal has happened.</p>

			<p>For the first time since we've been out here we
				took over in broad daylight yesterday afternoon,
				and I've never known Fritz so quiet as he was.
				Not only were there no shells, but very few bullets
				were flying while we were taking over, and the
				&mdash;&mdash;s were clearing out for their week in billets.
				We had everything in apple-pie order and the
				night's duties mapped out, stores checked, and
				ammunition dished out&mdash;the extra night supply
				I mean&mdash;before tea, and were just thinking how
				remarkably well-behaved the Boche was and
				what a great improvement it was to take over
				by daylight. And then the band played!</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

			<p>I had been counting the supply of bombs in the
				Company grenade store, and was in the act of
				setting my watch by Taffy's, standing there in the
				trench at a quarter to five, when, with a roar,
				shells landed in six different parts of our line; not
				in the trench, you know, but somewhere mighty
				close handy. Of course, you might say there
				was nothing very startling about half a dozen
				shells landing near us, especially as nobody was
				hit. And that's true. But there was something
				queer about it, all the same. We both felt it.
				Taffy looked at me, and I looked at him, and
				"Oho!" said Taffy. And I entirely agreed.</p>

			<p>Perhaps it was partly the unusual quietness that
				had come before. Anyhow, we both started at
				the double for Company Headquarters, and I
				know we both had the same idea&mdash;to see whether
				"the Peacemaker" wanted the word passed for
				everyone to take cover in such artillery shelters
				as we have now in this sector; and, mind you,
				they're miles better than they were when we first
				took over.</p>

			<p>But, bless your heart! we needn't have bothered
				getting word about it from the O.C. Before we
				got near the Company dug-out the men were
				seeing to that for themselves, as they have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
				taught to do, and the trenches were empty except,
				of course, for the sentries and their reliefs, who,
				with the observation officer, would remain at their
				posts even if the bottom fell out of the world.</p>

			<p>Such a raging frenzy of fire as there was when
				we met "the Peacemaker," outside the signallers'
				cabin, you never could imagine in your life, not if I
				wrote about it all night. One knows now that, on
				the average, there were not more than ninety projectiles
				per minute coming over us. But at the
				time, I assure you, it seemed there must be about
				ten a second, and that shells must be literally
				jostling each other in the air. Apart from anything
				else, the air was full of falling earth, wood,
				and barbed wire. It was clear they had begun by
				ranging on our parapet and entanglements. The
				oddest things were falling apparently from the
				sky&mdash;bits of trench boots, bully beef tins, shovel
				handles, stakes six feet long, lengths of wire,
				crumpled sheets of iron, and all kinds of stuff.</p>

			<p>I yelled to the O.C. that I would take observation
				duty, and Taffy wanted to take it with me.
				But "the Peacemaker" very properly insisted on
				his going to ground. We had to shout right in
				each other's ears. The O.C. told me our telephone
				wires were cut to ribbons already. "But Head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>quarters
				will know as much about this as we could
				tell 'em by now," he yelled. But he had sent off
				a chit by runner, just to let the C.O. know that
				our fellows had all taken cover, and that the
				heavy stuff seemed to be mostly landing on our
				front and the communication trenches immediately
				in rear. The O.C. made a cup of his hands
				and shouted in my ear as we crouched in the
				bottom of the trench:</p>

			<p>"What you've got to do is to watch for the
				lifting of the curtain to our rear. Must have
				every man on the fire-step then. They must
				surely mean to come across after this."</p>

			<p>"I hope so. 'A' Company 'll eat 'em if they
				do."</p>

			<p>"That's if we can keep cover now without too
				many casualties. Keep as good a look-out as you
				can. You'll find me here, by the signallers."</p>

			<p>So I left him, and made my way along to a little
				observing shelter we had made near the centre of
				our bit of firing line. But, when I got there, I
				found that shelter was just a heap of yeasty mud
				and rubbish. Fritz was pounding that bit out of
				all recognition. By this time, you know, one could
				hardly see six paces ahead anywhere. The smoke
				hung low, so that every shell in bursting made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
				long sheets of red flame along the smoke. And
				just then I got my first whiff of gas in the smoke:
				not a gas cloud, you know, but the burst of gas
				shells: lachrymatory shells some of 'em were. So
				I went hurrying along the line then, ordering all
				gas helmets on. I found most of the men had
				seen to this without being told.</p>

			<p>By the way, I ought to say that, so far as I can
				tell, bombardment doesn't affect one's mind much.
				You don't feel the slightest bit afraid. Only a lot
				more alert than usual, and rather keyed up, as you
				might be if you were listening to a fine orchestra
				playing something very stirring. It's rather a
				pleasant feeling, like the exhilaration you get from
				drinking champagne, or hearing a great speech
				on some big occasion when there are thousands of
				people listening and all pretty well worked up.
				As I scrambled along the fire trench I laughed once,
				because I found I was talking away nineteen to
				the dozen. I listened, as though it were to someone
				else, and I heard myself saying:</p>

			<p>"Let her rip! Let her rip, you blighters! You
				can't smash us, you sauer-krauters. You're only
				wasting the ammunition you'll be praying for presently.
				Wait till our heavies get to work on you,
				you beauties. You'll wish you hadn't spoken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
				Let her rip! Another dud! That was a rotten
				one. Why, you haven't got the range right even
				now, you rotters!"</p>

			<p>Wasn't it queer, jawing away like that, while
				they were hammering the stuffing out of our line?
				By the way, though I couldn't tell it then, our
				artillery was blazing away at them all the time.
				The fire was so tremendous that we positively
				had no idea our guns were in it at all. But, as a
				matter of fact, they were lambasting Old Harry
				out of the Boche support lines and communications,
				and the countless shells roaring over our
				heads were, half of them, our own.</p>

			<p>It seemed pretty clear to me that this bombardment
				was on a very narrow front, much less than
				our Company front even. It didn't seem to be
				much more than a platoon front. So I hurried
				along to the signals and let the O.C. know this.
				As I had expected, he told me to concentrate all
				the men, except sentries, on the flanks of the bombardment
				sector, all with smoke helmets on,
				rifles fully charged, bayonets fixed, and everything
				ready for instant action. He had already got
				our Lewis guns ready in the trench on both flanks.
				As a fact, "the Peacemaker" was doing as much
				observing as I was, and I made bold to tell him I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
				thought it wasn't the thing for him to expose
				himself as much as he did.</p>

			<p>"That's all right, old man," he shouted. "I'm
				looking out. I'll be careful, and you do the same.
				Here, stick your pipe in your mouth! It helps
				with the men."</p>

			<p>I'd had to tell him that in the centre and on the
				extreme left we had had a few casualties. The
				stretcher-bearers were doing their best for them.</p>

			<p>Not many minutes afterwards the curtain of fire
				appeared to be shifting back. The row was just as
				great, or greater. The smoke was just as dense,
				and there was a deal more gas in it. But it seemed
				to me there were very few shells actually landing
				along our front, and I could see the flashes of them
				bursting continuously a little in our rear.</p>

			<p>As I got to the left flank of the bombarded sector
				I found Taffy directing the fire of a machine-gun
				diagonally across the front. The men were all out
				there, and you could see them itching for the word
				to get over the parapet. Their faces were quite
				changed. Upon my word, I'd hardly have known
				some of 'em. They had the killing look, and
				nearly every man was fiddling with his bayonet,
				making sure he had the good steel ready for Fritz.
				Seeing they were all serene, I made my way along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
				to the other flank. I hardly thought about it,
				but just went, and that shows there's something
				shapes our ends, doesn't it? I should have been
				pretty sick afterwards if I hadn't made that way
				when I did.</p>

			<p>The first thing I saw on that flank was a couple
				of men lifting poor R&mdash;&mdash;'s body from the bottom
				of the trench. The Infant had been killed instantaneously.
				His head was absolutely smashed.
				He had been the most popular officer in our mess
				since we came out.</p>

			<p>There was no time to think, but the sight of the
				Infant, lying there dead, sent a kind of sudden
				heat through me from inside; as I felt it on patrol
				that night. I hurried on, with Corporal Slade
				close on my heels. The gassy smoke was very
				dense. Round the next traverse was the little
				bay from which the other machine-gun had been
				firing. It wasn't firing now. Two men were lying
				dead close beside it, and another badly wounded;
				and half across the parapet was Sergeant T&mdash;&mdash;,
				who'd been in charge of the gun, being hauled out
				by his arms by two Boches, while two other
				Boches stood by, one holding his rifle with bayonet
				fixed, in the thrust position, as if inclined to
				run T&mdash;&mdash; through. The other Boches were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
				shouting something in German. They wanted to
				make T&mdash;&mdash; prisoner. There was blood on one
				side of his neck. The insolence of the thing made
				me quite mad for the minute, and I screamed at
				those Boches like a maniac.</p>

			<p>It seems rum, but they turned and bolted into
				the smoke; I after them as hard as I could pelt.
				I shot one in the back with my revolver. He fell
				and, as I came up with him, I snatched his rifle
				from the ground beside him. I was like a lunatic.
				Then, just as suddenly, I came to my senses. The
				other Boches were out of sight in the smoke. I
				jumped back into the trench and put Corporal
				Slade on to the machine-gun, telling him to keep
				traversing that front. I ran farther down the
				trench to discover what had happened. The fire
				trench dipped there into a wooded hollow. The
				pounding of it had levelled the whole place till
				you could hardly make out the trench line.</p>

			<p>Here I found the bulk of my own platoon furiously
				scrapping with thirty or forty Boches over the
				parapet. It was splendid. I can't describe the
				feeling, as one rushed into it. But it was absolutely
				glorious. And it gave me my first taste of
				bayonet work in earnest&mdash;with a Boche bayonet in
				my hand, mark you. Made me quite glad of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
				bayonet practice we had at home with Sergeant
				W&mdash;&mdash;, after he'd had the course at Aldershot.
				No. 1 Platoon had never let the beggars get as
				far as our trench, but met 'em outside. To give
				them their due, those Boches didn't try any of
				their "Kamerade" business. They did fight&mdash;until
				they saw half their number stuck and down;
				and then they turned and bolted for it into the
				dense smoke over No Man's Land.</p>

			<p>They were most of 'em bayoneted in the back
				before I could get my fellows to turn. I didn't
				want them to go far in that dense fog of gassy
				smoke, and there was hardly any daylight left. I
				didn't want them tumbling into any ambush.
				On the way back we gathered up a score of Boche
				knives, a lot of their caps, two or three rifles, and
				a whole box of their hand grenades, with not one
				missing.</p>

			<p>That was the end of the first bombardment
				we've seen. It lasted exactly an hour, and our
				gunners tell us the Boche sent more than 5000
				shells over in that time. He has certainly knocked
				our line about rather badly. All hands are at
				work now repairing the trench and the wire, with
				a whole Company of R.E. to help. Our casualties
				were eighteen wounded and seven killed. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
				buried thirty-one dead Boches, and they removed
				a good many dead. We got eleven wounded and
				nine unwounded Boche prisoners. Of course,
				they took a lot of their wounded away. They
				captured no prisoners from us.</p>

			<p>I am sorry to say that another of our officers,

			<p>Your letters are a great joy, and I feel that I
				give mighty little in return for their unfailing
				regularity. But I am sure you will understand
				that out here, where there's no writing-table to
				turn to, one simply cannot write half as much as
				one would like. It's astonishing how few moments
				there are in which, without neglect, one can
				honestly say there is nothing waiting to be done.</p>

			<p>In your letter of the fifteenth, at this moment
				propped up in front of me against a condensed
				milk tin, you say: "When you can, I wish you'd
				jot down for me a sort of schedule of the ordinary,
				average day's work in the trenches when there is
				nothing special on, so that I can picture the routine
				of your life." Oh, for more ability as a jotter
				down! I know by what I used to see in the papers
				before leaving England there's a general idea at
				home that the chief characteristic of trench life is
				its dreary monotony, and that one of our problems
				is how to pass the time. How the idea ever got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
				abroad I can't imagine. I don't see how there
				ever could have been a time like that in trenches.
				Certainly we have never had a hint of it; not the
				shadow of a hint. If anyone has ever tasted the
				boredom of idleness in the trenches&mdash;which I
				don't believe, mind you&mdash;there must have been
				something radically wrong with his Battalion; his
				Company Commander must have been a rotter.
				And I don't see how <i>that</i> could be.</p>

			<p>A trench, especially in such country as this we're
				in, is not unlike a ship; a rather ancient and leaky
				wooden ship. If you don't keep busy about her
				she leaks like a sieve, gets unworkably encrusted
				and choked by barnacles, and begins to decay.
				If you don't keep improving her, she jolly soon
				begins to go to pieces. Only, I imagine the disintegrating
				process is a great deal quicker in a
				trench in this part of the world than it could be in
				the most unseaworthy of ships.</p>

			<p>The daily routine? Well, it would be wrong
				to say there isn't any. There is. But it differs
				every day and every hour of the day, except in
				certain stable essentials. Every day brings happenings
				that didn't come the day before. One
				fixed characteristic is that it's a twenty-four day,
				rather than twelve hours of day and twelve hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
				of night. Of course, the overruling factor is
				strafe. But there's also something pretty bossy
				about the condition of your trench. Some kind
				of repairs simply cannot wait. The trench must
				continue to provide cover from observation, and
				some sort of cover from fire, or it ceases to be
				tenable, and one would not be carrying out one's
				fundamental duty of properly holding the sector
				of line to which one is detailed; which, obviously,
				would be unthinkable. Still, as I say, there are
				some elements of stable routine. Well, here goes.
				It won't cover the ground. I'm not a competent
				enough jotter down for that, but such as it is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

			<p>We think of every fresh day as beginning with
				"Stand-to." The main idea behind this function
				is that dawn is the classic moment for an attack.
				I'm not quite sure that this or any other classic
				idea holds good in trench warfare, but "Stand-to"
				is a pretty sound sort of an institution, anyhow.
				We Stand-to one hour before daylight. In some
				Companies the precise hour is laid down overnight
				or for the week. Our skipper doesn't believe in
				that. He likes to make a sort of a test of every
				Stand-to, and so gives no notice beforehand of the
				time at which he is going to order it. And I
				think he's right.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

			<p>You will easily understand that of all things in
				trench warfare nothing is more important than the
				ability of your Company to man the fire-step,
				ready to repel an attack, or to make one, on the
				shortest possible notice. When the order comes
				there must be no fiddling about looking for rifles,
				or appearing on the fire-step with incomplete
				equipment. See how useless that would be in the
				event of a surprise attack in the dark, when the
				enemy could creep very close indeed to your parapet
				before the best of sentries could give any alarm!
				Troops in the firing line must be able to turn out,
				equipped in every detail for fighting&mdash;for days on
				end of fighting&mdash;not only quickly, but instantly;
				without any delay at all. That is why, in the
				British Army, at all events&mdash;and I've no doubt
				the French are the same&mdash;nobody in the firing line
				is allowed to remove his equipment. Officer and
				man alike, when we lie down to sleep, we lie down
				in precisely the same order as we go into action:
				haversack and water-bottle, ammunition and
				everything complete. That detail of the filled
				water-bottle, for instance, may make all the
				difference between a man who is an asset to his
				country in a critical action and a man who is
				useless and a bad example. You never know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
				moment at which an action that will last forty-eight
				hours or more is going to begin; and, though
				a man may keep going a long while without
				food, he's not much use if he cannot rinse his
				mouth out after a bit.</p>

			<p>But at this rate I shall never get done. It's
				always so when I set out to write to you about
				any specific thing.</p>

			<p>Well, we Stand-to an hour before dawn. It
				happens this way: "the Peacemaker" is in the
				trench doing something, or he comes out of the
				dug-out. He looks at his watch and at the sky,
				and he tells his orderly to bring another orderly.
				Then he says to the pair of them: "Pass the word
				to Stand-to." One bolts along the trench to the
				left and one to the right; and as they hurry along
				they give the word to every sentry and to everyone
				they see: "Stand-to!" Meanwhile "the Peacemaker"
				pokes about and observes, and jumps like
				a hundred of bricks on any man whose bayonet is
				not fixed, whose belt is unbuckled, or who is slow
				in getting to the fire-step. All this time he has
				his watch in his hand.</p>

			<p>Pretty soon the first of those two orderlies comes
				racing back. Very often they see each other
				approaching the Officer Commanding from oppo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>site
				directions, and make a real race of it, and
				report breathlessly: "All correct, sir." To be
				able to do this, they must have got the word from
				each Platoon Sergeant. Probably about this time
				the officer on duty comes along from whatever part
				of the line he happens to have been patrolling
				at the time. And he also reports that all was correct
				in the part of the line he has come from, or that
				such and such a section was a bit behind this
				morning, and that Corporal So-and-so wants a
				little stirring up.</p>

			<p>Also, by this time the Company Sergeant-Major
				will have arrived, with a couple of runners, each
				carrying under his arm a jar of mixed rum-and-water,
				half and half. Rum is never served out
				in any circumstances, save in the presence of an
				officer. So the officer on duty goes to one end of
				the line, and "the Peacemaker" to the other, and
				both work slowly back toward the centre, watching
				the serving out of the rum, and looking carefully
				over each man and his equipment. In the centre,
				the officer on duty probably waits, while the O.C.
				Company goes right on, so that he may see the
				whole of his line and every single man in it. So
				you see, in a way, Stand-to is a parade, as well
				as an important tactical operation. Because, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>member,
				the sentries are keenly watching all this
				while, and so are a good many more pairs of eyes
				than look out at any other time. But, whereas
				the sentries are steadily gazing into the rapidly
				greying mysteries of No Man's Land, the other
				pairs of eyes are only taking occasional sharp
				glances, and then down again, below the parapet.</p>

			<p>There has probably been very little firing from
				either side during this time. Now, very suddenly,
				a violent crackling starts along to the left of
				the line. Instantly, every exposed head ducks.
				Fritz has started the first verse of his morning
				Hymn of Hate. He always thinks to catch us,
				and never does. We enjoy his hymn, because we
				love to see him waste his ammunition, as he proceeds
				to do now in handsome style. Br-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r!
				The spray of his machine-guns traverses
				very neatly up and down the length of our parapet.
				His gunners are clearly convinced that at Stand-to
				time they are certain to get a few English heads.
				Then, as suddenly as he began, he stops; and&mdash;every
				head remains ducked. We've been at some
				pains to teach 'em that. Twenty seconds later&mdash;or
				it may be two minutes&mdash;the spray begins again,
				just where it stopped, or a hundred yards to right
				or left of that. The Boche is quite smart about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
				this; only he seems to act on the assumption that
				we never learn anything. That's where he's
				rather sold.</p>

			<p>And, while Fritz sends forth his morning Hymn,
				our snipers in their carefully-hidden posts have
				their eyes glued on the neighbourhood of his
				machine-gun emplacements; and every now and
				again they get their reward, and the head of a
				Boche machine-gun observer, or some other Teuton
				whose curiosity overcomes his discretion, drops
				never to rise any more.</p>

			<p>Before the Hymn began, you understand, the
				greying mystery has grown considerably less mysterious,
				and one has been able to see almost as
				much in the pearly dawn light as one will see at
				high noon, especially in these misty localities.</p>

			<p>When Fritz has got through the last verse of his
				Hymn he is almost invariably quiet and harmless
				as a sucking dove for an hour or two. I take it he
				makes a serious business of his breakfast. And
				there again he often pays. Our snipers have
				their brekker later, and devote half an hour now
				to observation of the neighbourhood of all the little
				spirals of smoke in the Boche lines which indicate
				breakfast fires. They generally have some luck
				then; and sometimes it becomes worth while to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
				turn on a machine-gun or two, where Fritz's
				appetite has made him careless.</p>

			<p>It is now broad daylight, and our ration parties
				appear, four to each platoon, trailing up the trenches
				from the rear with the breakfast tea and bacon.
				Each party dumps its dixey of tea down in the
				centre of the sector of its platoon, and the Platoon
				Sergeant dishes out to the section commanders
				the whack of bacon for their sections, while all
				hands draw their mugs of tea. The bread and
				jam and "dry rations" were drawn overnight.
				And so to breakfast, in the dug-outs or along the
				fire-step, according to the state of the weather.
				It's breakfast for all hands, except the sentries,
				and they are relieved to get theirs directly the
				men to relieve them have eaten. With the exception
				of those who are on duty, the officers get along
				to the Company dug-out for their breakfast, which
				the batmen have been preparing. They cook it,
				you know, over a brazier&mdash;some old pail or tin with
				holes punched in it, consuming coke and charcoal
				mixed, or whatever fuel one has. Fried bacon,
				tea, and bread-and-jam; that's our usual menu.
				Sometimes there may be a tin of fruit as well,
				or some luxury of that sort from home. Always
				there are good appetites and no need of sauce.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

			<p>But, look here, I've just got to stop now. And
				yet I've only reached breakfast in my jotting of
				the day's routine in trenches. Isn't it maddening?
				Well, I'll get another chance to-night or to-morrow,
				and give you some more of it. I really will finish
				it, and I'm sorry I couldn't have done it in one
				letter, as it would have been done by a more
				competent jotter-down of things than your</p>

			<p>You'll be grieved to hear that cheery, indomitable
				little Tommy Dodd was rather badly laid out this
				morning; four or five nasty wounds from shrapnel.
				But I think he'll pull through. He has so much of
				the will to live, and I am sure a soul so uniformly
				cheerful as his must make its body easier to heal.</p>

			<p>I wasn't six paces from him at the time. We
				were fastening some barbed-wire stays on screw
				standards we meant to put out to-night. I had just
				lent him my thick leather gloves after showing him
				exactly how I wanted these stays fixed, with little
				stakes bound on at the end of them, so as to save
				time to-night when we are over the parapet. He was
				busy as a beaver, as he generally is; a bit nearer
				to Whizz-bang Corner than was quite wise&mdash;I
				shall always reproach myself for not keeping him
				farther from that ill-omened spot&mdash;when the shell
				burst low overhead. I got a dozen tiny flicks
				myself on hands and head, which the M.O. touched
				up with iodine after he bandaged Tommy Dodd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
				But Tommy was badly hit in the thigh, one arm,
				and the left shoulder.</p>

			<p>He was parchment-colour by the time I got the
				stretcher-bearers along, and that was only a matter
				of seconds. We were close to their little dug-out,
				as it happened. He'd lost a lot of blood. But he
				grinned at me, with a kind of twist in his grin, as
				I helped lift him into the trench stretcher.</p>

			<p>"Looks almost like a Blighty for me, sir, don't
				it? Well, even the Boche must hit something
				sometimes. It's only an outer this time, an' look
				at the thousands o' rounds when he don't get on
				the target at all! Sorry I couldn't 've finished
				them stays, sir. If you send for Davis, o' Number
				5 Section, you'll find him pretty good at it,
				sir." And then he turned to the stretcher-bearer
				in front, who had the strap over his shoulder, and
				was just bracing himself to start off when he'd
				done talking. "Home, John!" he says, with a
				little kick up of his head, which I really can't
				describe. "An' be sure you don't exceed the
				limit, for I can't abide them nasty low perlice
				courts an gettin' fined."</p>

			<p>And yet, when we got down to Battalion Headquarters,
				the M.O. told me Tommy Dodd ought by
				all rights to have been insensible, from the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
				he'd lost and the shock of those wounds: not surface
				wounds, you know. He'll have two or three
				months of hospital comfort now. I hope to goodness
				nothing septic will intervene. The Battalion
				would be the poorer for it if we lost Tommy.
				The M.O. says he'll pull through. The M.O.
				cropped little patches of hair off round my head,
				to rub the iodine in where I was scratched, so I
				look as if I had ringworm.</p>

			<p>But to get back to business. I've got to "jot
				down" this everyday trench routine for you,
				haven't I? And I only got as far as breakfast
				in yesterday's letter. We'll get a move on
				and run through it now. I'm due on deck directly
				after lunch to relieve Taffy; and it's past
				eleven now.</p>

			<p>After breakfast one-half the men kip down for a
				sleep, and the other half turn to for work. Then
				after the mid-day dinner, the half that rested in
				the forenoon, work; and throughout the night
				all hands stand their turn at sentry-go. That's
				the principle&mdash;in our Company, anyhow. But, of
				course, it doesn't always work out quite like that.
				Everything naturally gives way to strafing considerations,
				and at times urgent repairing work
				makes it necessary to forgo half or all the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
				rest-time. As for the officers&mdash;there are only
				three of us now, besides "the Peacemaker"&mdash;one
				officer is always on duty, day and night.
				We take that in three-hour spells, the three of us.
				Then in the day-time, while the turn of duty is a
				fixed thing, we are, as a matter of fact, about at
				some job or another all the time; just as the O.C.
				Company is about all the twenty-four hours.
				At night we three do take our time off for sleep
				after a tour of duty, unless in some emergency
				or other. "The Peacemaker" just gets odd cat-naps
				when he can.</p>

			<p>You might think that if there'd been no particular
				artillery strafing going on there would be no
				necessary repair work for the men to do in the
				trench. But you see, we've practically always
				got a new dug-out in course of construction, and a
				refuse pit to be dug, and a sniping shelter to be
				made, and a new bit of trench to be cut. We have
				nine separate sumps where pumps are fixed in our
				line. And if those pumps were not well worked
				each day we'd soon be flooded out. There's
				generally some wire and standards to be got ready
				for putting out at night, with a few "Gooseberries"
				and trip wires where our entanglements
				have been weakened by shell fire. I've never yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
				seen a trench that wasn't crying out for some sort
				of work on it.</p>

			<p>At breakfast "the Peacemaker" will generally
				talk over the jobs he specially wants us to put
				through during the day, and give us any notes he
				may have taken during the night, round the
				trenches. Then chits begin coming in by 'phone
				from Battalion Headquarters; and chits, however
				short and innocent they may look, nearly always
				boil down to a job of work to be done. In fact,
				one way and another, jobs invariably invade the
				breakfast table and every other meal-time; and
				before the tea-mugs are filled up a second time
				one nearly always hears a batman told to "clear
				this end, will you, to make room for me to write
				a chit."</p>

			<p>Then there will be a visitor, probably the C.O.,
				pretty soon after breakfast, and "the Peacemaker"
				will trot round our line with him, discussing. Ten
				to one that visit will mean more jobs of work;
				and, occasionally, what's a deal more welcome,
				a new plan for a little strafe of some sort.</p>

			<p>And then one sees the ration parties trailing up
				again from the rear, and dinner has arrived; some
				kind of a stew, you know, as a rule, with bully as
				alternative; potatoes if you're lucky, jam any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>how,
				more tea, and some sort of pickings from
				home parcels in the way of cake or biscuits, figs
				or what not. During and immediately after
				dinner&mdash;in the dug-out we call it lunch, from
				habit, but it's about the same thing as the evening
				meal, as a rule&mdash;we always plan out the
				night's work, patrols, wiring, any little strafe we
				have on, and that sort of thing.</p>

			<p>We are a bit luxurious in "A" Company, and
				generally run to a mug of afternoon tea; sometimes
				(if the recent mails have been heavy) to
				an outburst of plum cake or shortbread with it.
				And an hour before dark comes evening Stand-to.
				Technically, this has some tactical significance,
				even as the morning Stand-to has actually. But
				as a matter of fact, in the evening it's a parade,
				more than anything else, to inspect rifles, check up
				ammunition, call the roll, and see the men are all
				right.</p>

			<p>By the way, you asked me something about the
				rum. I don't think it's issued at all in the summer
				months. What we issue now, once a day, is, I
				think, one gill per man of the half-and-half mixture
				of rum and water. I think it's a gill; a pint mug
				has to supply eight men. I think, on the whole,
				it's a useful issue, and can't possibly do any harm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
				It's thundering good rum; good, honest, mellow
				stuff, and very warming.</p>

			<p>About seven o'clock we generally have a feed,
				from habit, you know, that being the time we
				used to have dinner in camp in England. It's the
				same sort of feed we have in middle day. And
				after that, the officer who is going on duty at
				midnight, say, will generally get a sleep. The usual
				round of night work is well under way by now&mdash;patrols,
				wiring parties, work on the parapet, and so
				on, according to what the moon allows. If there's
				too much light, these things have to come later.</p>

			<p>With regard to work for sentry reliefs, the way
				we have in our Company is this: a sentry's relief&mdash;the
				sentries are always double by night and
				single by day&mdash;must always be within call of the
				sentry; therefore we never let him go beyond the
				bay next to the one the sentry occupies, that is,
				round the next traverse. Well, we hold the
				reliefs responsible for keeping those two bays in
				good order; clean and pumped, sides revetted,
				fire-step clear and in repair, the duck-boards
				lifted and muck cleared out from under them each
				day, and so forth. All used cartridges have to be
				gathered up and put in the sand-bag hung over the
				fire-step for that purpose, for return to store.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

			<p>Unless there is real strafing going on the trenches
				grow pretty silent after midnight. At least, it
				seems so to the officer on duty as he makes his
				way from one end of his line to the other. One
				gets very tired then. There's never any place
				where you can sit down in a trench. I am sure
				the O.C. Company is often actually on his feet
				for twenty-two out of the twenty-four hours.
				I say it's very quiet. Well, it's a matter of comparison,
				of course. If in the middle of the street
				at two o'clock in the morning at home you heard
				a few rifles fired, you would think it remarkably
				noisy. But here, if there's nothing going on except
				rifle fire, say at the rate of a couple of shots a
				minute, the trenches seem extraordinarily quiet;
				ghostly quiet.</p>

			<p>You go padding along in your gum boots, feeling
				your way with your stick, which usually carries
				such a thick coat of mud on it that its taps on the
				duck-boards are hardly audible. You come round
				the corner of a traverse, and spot a sentry's helmet
				against the sky-line. "Who goes there?" he
				challenges you, hoarsely, and you answer, "Lieutenant
				So-and-so, &mdash;&mdash; Regiment," and he gives
				you leave to pass.</p>

			<p>One has to be careful about these challenges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
				At first the men were inclined to be casual and
				grunt out, "Tha's all right!" or just the name of
				the Regiment when challenged. One had to
				correct that tendency. It is easy for a Boche to
				learn to say "Tha's all right," or to mention the
				name of a Regiment opposite his line. Plenty of
				them have been waiters, barbers, clerks, bakers,
				and so on in London. So we insist on formal
				correctness in these challenges, and the officer
				or man who doesn't halt promptly on being challenged
				takes his chance of a bullet or a bayonet
				in his chest.</p>

			<p>One stops for a word or two with every sentry,
				and one creeps out along the saps for a word with
				the listening posts. It helps them through their
				time, and it satisfies you that they're on the spot,
				mentally as well as physically. There's hardly
				a man in "A" Company who is not an inveterate
				smoker, but, do you know, I have never once got a
				whiff of 'baccy smoke in the neighbourhood of a
				sentry since we've been in trenches, never a suspicion

				was not genuinely watching to his front; and if the

				there's not one of them ever betrayed into turning
				his eyes from his front. They're good lads.</p>

			<p>We are trying to work one of our little cunning
				stunts to-day. Last night I had an observation
				patrol out, and having no special job on, decided
				to devote our time to the examination of the
				Boche wire&mdash;their entanglements, you know, in
				the sector opposite our particular line. I had only
				two men with me: one of my own Platoon scouts
				and a lad named Hankin, of whom I have great
				hopes as a sniper. He's in my No. 3 Section, and
				a very safe and pretty shot with a rifle, especially
				at long ranges. He'd never been on patrol and
				was most anxious to go, and to have an opportunity
				of looking at the Boche line, to verify his
				suspicions regarding certain holes in the ground
				which he thought their snipers used. Our patrol
				had two interesting results, for one of which we
				have to thank Hankin's intelligence. The other
				was a bit of luck. The reason I took such a small
				patrol was that the aim was observation pure and
				simple; not strafing; and the men were more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
				usually tired, and had a lot of parapet repair
				work which had to be put through before daylight.</p>

			<p>It was about a quarter to one in the morning
				when we went out, there having been too much
				moonlight before then. Hankin had prepared a
				regular chart of the Boche line from his own
				observations from his sniping post; quite a clever
				little map it is, showing clearly his suspected
				sniping shelters, of which there are four. We
				drew a blank in the first two of these, and for the
				third had to tack back from the line of the Boche
				wire, towards our own, along the side of an old
				sap, all torn to bits and broken in with shell fire.
				Hankin felt certain he had seen the flash of rifles
				from this hole; but I thought it was too near our
				own wire to attract any Boche sniper for regular
				use.</p>

			<p>I need hardly say that on a job of this sort one
				moves very slowly, and uses the utmost possible
				precaution to prevent noise. It was now absolutely
				dark, the moon having gone down and the
				sky being much overcast. But for my luminous-faced
				compass (which one consults under one's
				coat flap to prevent it from showing) we should
				have been helpless. As it was, on the bearings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
				I worked out before starting, we steered comfortably
				and fairly accurately.</p>

			<p>All of a sudden came a shock, a rifle fired, as
				it seemed, under our noses, actually from about
				twenty-five paces ahead on the track we were
				making.</p>

			<p>"That's him, sir," breathed Hankin in my
				right ear.</p>

			<p>I looked at the compass. The shot came from
				dead on the spot where Hankin's third hole should
				be; the one we were making for then.</p>

			<p>"How about a little bomb for him, sir?" whispered
				the scout on my left.</p>

			<p>But I shook my head. Too much like looking
				for a needle in a bundle of hay, and too much like
				asking the Boche for machine-gun fire. It was
				fair to assume the Boche sniper who fired that shot
				would be facing our trenches; the same direction
				in which we were facing at that moment, since we
				were working back from the German wire towards
				our own. I pushed my lips close up to Hankin's
				ear and whispered: "We'll try stalking him."
				Hankin nodded, quite pleased.</p>

			<p>Then I whispered to the scout to follow us very,
				very carefully, and not too closely. I didn't want
				him to lose touch, but, for the sake of quietness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
				one would sooner, of course, go alone. We kept
				about six paces between us laterally, Hankin
				and myself, and we advanced by inches.</p>

			<p>I must say I should have been grateful for a
				shade more light, or less inky blackness. The
				edge of that sniper's hole was not sloping, but
				sheer; and, crawling slowly along, I struck my
				right hand clean over it into nothingness, letting
				my chest down with an audible bump. Right
				before me then I heard a man's body swing round
				on the mud, and the sniper let out some kind of
				a German exclamation which was a sort of squeal.
				It was, really, much more like some wild animal's
				cry than anything human. I had to chance it
				then. The sound was so amazingly close. I
				couldn't see him, but&mdash; And when I sprang,
				the thing my hands gripped on first was not the
				beggar's windpipe or shoulders, as I had hoped,
				but his rifle, carried in his left hand on his left
				side.</p>

			<p>It was rather like tom-cats coming to blows. I
				swear he spat. As you know, I'm rather heavy,
				and I think my spring, slightly to his left, knocked
				him off his balance. He hadn't any chance.
				But, though I got his left wrist, and covered his
				mouth with my chest, I was a bit uneasy about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
				his right hand, which for the moment I couldn't
				find. Lucky for me he hadn't got a dagger in it,
				or he might have ripped me open. But Hankin
				pretty soon found his right hand, and then we
				hauled him up to his feet. I passed his rifle to
				the scout, and we just marched him along the
				front of our wire to Stinking Sap, and so into
				our own front trench; Hankin holding one of his
				arms, I taking the other, and the scout coming
				behind with the muzzle of the man's own rifle
				in the small of his back. There was no need to
				crawl, the night being as black as your hat; and
				in three or four minutes we had that sniper in
				front of "the Peacemaker" in the Company
				dug-out.</p>

			<p>It was neat, wasn't it? And all thanks to the
				ingenious Hankin's careful observations and his
				chart. He'll get his first stripe for that, and very
				soon have another to keep it company, or I'm
				much mistaken. "The Peacemaker" was delighted,
				and wrote a full report of the capture to
				be sent down to Headquarters with the prisoner.
				Snipers are worth capturing, you know, and this
				looked like an intelligent chap whose cross-examination
				might be useful to our Brass-hats.</p>

			<p>Queer thing about this sniper, he spoke English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
				almost like a native. We are not allowed to
				examine prisoners on our own account. All that's
				done by the powers behind the line. But this
				fellow volunteered a little talk while we were
				getting the report made out. He was quite
				satisfied when he realised we were not going to
				harm him in any way, but it was perfectly clear
				he had expected to be done in. You'd have
				thought he would have known better. He'd
				spent nine years in London, part of the time a
				waiter, and later a clerk. He had lived at Kennington,
				and then in lodgings on Brixton Hill, I'll
				trouble you. Extraordinary, isn't it? He'd been
				told that London was practically in ruins, and
				that the Zepps had made life there impossible.
				He also thought that we in France were completely
				cut off from England, the Channel being in the
				hands of the German Navy, and England isolated
				and rapidly starving! I gather the Boches in the
				fighting line have no notion at all of the real facts
				of the war.</p>

			<p>Well, having been so far successful, we decided to
				resume our patrol, the main purpose of which&mdash;examination
				of the Boche wire&mdash;hadn't been touched
				yet. So off we went again down Stinking Sap;
				and I could see that Hankin and Green, the scout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
				bore themselves as victors, with something of the
				swank of the old campaigner and hero of a thousand
				patrols. A great asset, mind you, is a reasonable
				amount of swank. These two had not been out
				before this night, but already they climbed over
				the parapet and moved about in No Man's Land
				with a real and complete absence of the slightest
				hint of nervousness.</p>

			<p>Now I must cut this short because I have to go
				an errand for "the Peacemaker," to have a little
				talk with a Battery Commander. We had a
				pretty good prowl up and down the Boche wire,
				and made an interesting discovery on the extreme
				left of our sector. There was a shade more light
				then; not from the moon, of course, but from stars;
				the sky having become less overcast. I ran my
				nose right up against a miniature sign-post; a
				nice little thing, with feathers stuck in cracks near
				the top of it, presumably to give Boche patrols
				their bearings. I should have liked to take it
				away as a souvenir, but I didn't want to arouse
				Hun suspicions, so left it. The interesting thing
				was that this little sign-post&mdash;about eighteen
				inches high, planted among the front wire stakes&mdash;pointed
				the way in to the Boche trenches by an
				S-shaped lane through their wire entanglements;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
				so shaped, of course, as to prevent it from being
				easily seen from our line.</p>

			<p>We crawled along this lane a bit, far enough to
				make sure that it was a clear fairway into the
				Boche front trench. Then I got a careful bearing,
				which I subsequently verified half a dozen times;
				and we made our way back to Stinking Sap. I
				haven't time to tell you of our cunning plan about
				this discovery. That's what I'm to see the
				Battery Commander about. But if we can make
				the arrangement we want to make with the gunners,
				we'll bring off a nice little bombing raid
				to-night, and I'll let you know all about it in my
				next letter. Meanwhile I must scurry off, or I
				shall miss the Battery Commander in his rounds,
				and there will be a telling-off for your</p>

			<p>Out of trenches again. I wanted to write you
				yesterday to tell you about the bombing raid of
				our last night in; but we had a full day, and were
				not relieved till late evening; so I got no chance of
				writing till this afternoon. But I can tell you we
				came out with our tails well up this time, and "A"
				Company putting on more side than ever. I dare
				say "D" Company, our closest rivals, will put up
				something pretty startling when we go in again.
				They're very determined to beat our record in
				every kind of strafing, and I'm bound to say they
				do put up some good shows. They've two more
				officers than we have now, and the Boche has
				discovered that they are very much out for business.</p>

			<p>Whether we get Bavarians or Prussians opposite
				us it makes small odds; they've no earthly chance
				of a quiet time while we're in the line. The
				public at home read about the big things, and I
				suppose when they read that "The rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
				Front was quiet," they're inclined to wonder how
				we put our time in. Ah, well! the "quiet" of the
				dispatches wouldn't exactly suit a conscientious
				objector, I can assure you. It's a kind of "quiet"
				that keeps Master Boche pretty thoroughly on the
				hop. But on the whole, I'm rather glad the dispatches
				are like that. I'd be sorry to see 'em
				make a song and dance about these little affairs
				of ours. Only, don't you run away with the idea
				that when you read "Remainder of the Front
				quiet," it means the Boche was being left alone;
				for he isn't, not by long odds.</p>

			<p>You will remember that opposite our extreme
				left I had discovered an S-shaped opening leading
				through the barbed wire to the Boche front line, so
				cut, no doubt, for the convenience of their patrols
				at night. We decided that we would make use of
				that opening for a bombing raid on our last night
				in. Now, you must understand that one of the
				chief uses of the barbed-wire entanglements is to
				keep off the prowling bomber. The entanglements
				extend to, say, forty to sixty paces from the
				trench. You cannot hope to make accurate
				practice in bomb-throwing at a distance of more
				than thirty yards. Consequently, as I explained
				before, to shy bombs into the average trench the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
				bomber must worry his way through twenty paces
				or so of barbed-wire entanglements. It is very
				difficult to do that without attracting the attention
				of sentries, and impossible to do it quickly with
				or without noise. Hence you perceive the unpleasant
				predicament of the bomber when he has
				heaved his first bomb. He has offered himself
				as a target to the Boche machine-guns and rifles
				at a moment when he is in the midst of a maze
				of barbed wire, from which he can only hope to
				retreat slowly and with difficulty.</p>

			<p>Then why not cut a lane through the Boche
				wire by means of shells, just before dark, and use
				that to bomb from after dark? Excellent. Only,
				if you were the Boche and we cut a lane through
				your wire one evening just before dark, wouldn't
				you train a machine-gun or two on that opening
				so that you could sweep it with fire at any moment
				you wished during the night; and wouldn't you
				have a dozen extra rifles with keen eyes behind 'em
				trained on the same spot; and wouldn't you be
				apt to welcome that nice little lane as a trap in
				which you could butcher English Tommies like
				sitting pheasants? Wouldn't you now?</p>

			<p>Well, my business with the Battery Commander
				was to get on his right side and induce him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
				expend a certain number of rounds from his dear
				little guns that afternoon in cutting a nice line
				through the Boche entanglements opposite the
				extreme right of our line. It happened that,
				without interfering with the sort of sinking fund
				process by which the lords of the guns build up
				their precious reserves of ammunition, this particular
				lord was in a position to let us have a few
				rounds.</p>

			<p>Of course, our attitude towards the gunners is
				not always strictly reasonable, you know. We are
				for ever wanting them to spend ammunition, while
				their obvious duty is to accumulate ammunition
				greedily and all the time against the hours of real
				need, so that when these hours come they may
				simply let everything rip&mdash;take the lid right off.
				However, for reasons of their own, apart from
				mine, it happened fortunately that the gunners
				were not at all averse from giving that bit of the
				Boche line a mild pounding; and, accordingly,
				they promised us a nice neat lane on the extreme
				right by nightfall.</p>

			<p>We said nothing about the beautiful S-shaped
				lane on the extreme left, which Master Boche
				thought was known only to himself. Observe
				our extreme artfulness. We proceeded to train a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
				grenade rifle on the extreme right, likewise a
				machine-gun. Then we proceeded to tell off our
				best bombers, and overhaul carefully a good
				supply of hand-grenades for use in the S-shaped
				opening on our extreme left.</p>

			<p>Until midnight there was a certain amount of
				moonlight, and for several hours we kept the Boche
				very busy on our extreme right, where, with a
				trifling expenditure of ammunition, the guns had
				cut a lane for us through his barbed wire. I've no
				doubt at all that Fritz had several machine-guns
				concentrated on that spot, and a bunch of rifle-men
				too. He made up his mind he would have
				the English on toast in that lane, and we
				encouraged him to think so.</p>

			<p>You know, at night-time it is not very easy to
				tell the difference between the explosion of a
				hand-grenade and that of a rifle-grenade. But
				whereas the hand-grenade could only be lobbed
				in from among the wire, the rifle-grenade could
				easily be sent over from our trench at that particular
				spot on our right. So we sent 'em over at all
				kinds of confusing intervals. And then, when
				Boche opened machine-gun fire across the lane,
				under the impression that our bombers were at
				work there, we replied with bursts of machine-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>gun
				fire on his parapet opposite the lane, thereby,
				I make no doubt, getting a certain number of
				heads. It is certain they would be looking out,
				and equally certain they would not be expecting
				fire from our trenches, when they thought we had
				our own bombers out there.</p>

			<p>It was an attractive game, and we kept it going
				till nearly midnight. Then we stopped dead,
				leaving them to suppose we had given up hope of
				overcoming their watchfulness. We arranged to
				reopen the ball at 1.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> precisely, with rifle-grenades
				and machine-gun fire as might prove
				suitable, but with no end of a row in any case.</p>

			<p>At one o'clock I started from Stinking Sap, on
				our extreme left, with twelve of our best bombers,
				each carrying an apronful of bombs. There
				wasn't a glimmer of any kind of light. We made
				direct for the S-shaped opening, and lay down
				outside the wire there. In our own trench,
				before starting, we had made all arrangements.
				I had six men on either side of me, and each man
				knew precisely what his particular job was.
				"The Peacemaker" never tires of insisting on that
				principle, and, of course, he is right. Nothing is
				any good unless it is worked out beforehand so
				that each man knows exactly his job, and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>centrates
				on that without reference to anyone
				else, or any hanging about waiting instructions.</p>

			<p>At 1.20 we began crawling down the S-shaped
				opening in our proper order. At 1.30 the first
				rifle-grenade ripped over from the extreme right
				of our line. Others followed in quick succession,
				and on the report of the sixth we jumped to our
				feet and ran forward, extending to right and left
				from me as we reached the inside of the wire, and
				chucking our first bombs&mdash;thirteen of 'em&mdash;as we
				got into position. It was so close there was no
				possibility of missing, and I can tell you thirteen
				bombs make some show when they all explode
				beautifully right inside a trench a few yards in
				front of you.</p>

			<p>Then we all scrambled over the parapet down
				into the trench over a front of, say, thirty paces.
				The six men on my right hand at once turned to
				their right, and those on my left to their left. It
				worked splendidly. Each party travelled along
				the trench as quickly as it could, bombing over
				each traverse before rounding it. The row was
				terrific.</p>

			<p>In that order each party went along six successive
				bays of the trench. Then immediately
				they began to reverse the process, travelling more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
				slowly this time and bombing more thoroughly.
				They were working back on their centre now, you
				understand, still bombing outward, of course.
				We had the luck to strike a splendid piece of trench
				with no fewer than three important dug-outs in it,
				and we made a shambles of each of them. It was
				wildly exciting while it lasted, but I suppose we
				were not more than four or five minutes in the
				trench. We exploded thirty-two bombs during
				those few minutes, every single one of them with
				good effect; and when we scrambled out into the
				S-shaped opening again we took with us an undamaged
				Boche machine-gun and four prisoners,
				one of them wounded and three unwounded. We
				killed nine men in the trench, and a good round
				number in the three dug-outs. I had a bunch of
				maps and papers from the first of those dug-outs.
				And we didn't improve their trench or the dug-outs.
				Thirty-two bombs make a difference.</p>

			<p>The machine-gun hampered us a bit, but I can
				tell you we made pretty good time getting across
				to Stinking Sap. The Boches were hopelessly
				confused by the whole business, and while we were
				crossing to the extreme left of our own line they
				were wildly blazing at our extreme right and pouring
				flares and machine-gun fire over the lane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
				through their wire. Naturally, nobody was in the
				least exposed on our right, except perhaps the
				man operating the machine-gun, which probably
				did good execution among Boche observers of
				that neat little lane our artillery had cut for us.</p>

			<p>It was a delightful show and cost us nothing in
				casualties, except two men very slightly wounded,
				one in the right foot and the other in the left hand
				and arm from our own bomb splinters. But, as
				our good old bombing Sergeant said, it "fairly
				put the wind up them bloomin' sauer-krauters."
				Incidentally, and owing far more to the fine
				behaviour of the men than to anything I did, it
				earned a lot of bouquets from different quarters
				for your</p>

			<p>P.S.&mdash;Next day's report as served up to you

			<p>I dare say you've heard that phrase&mdash;I forget

				being the non-commissioned man. I suspect it
				was all right when it was written, and goodness
				knows, there's not much the matter with the non-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>commissioned
				man to-day. Only, there isn't the
				difference that there was between the N.C.O. and
				the "other ranks"&mdash;the men. The N.C.O. isn't
				the separate type he was, because the N.C.O.
				of to-day is so often the man of yesterday; promotion
				having necessarily been rapid in the New
				Army. We had to make our own N.C.O.'s from
				the start. They're all backbone, now, men and
				N.C.O.'s alike. And the officers are quite all right,
				thank you, too. I doubt whether officers in any
				Army have ever worked harder than the officers of
				our New Army&mdash;the "Temporary Gentlemen,"
				you know&mdash;are working to-day. They have had
				to work hard. Couldn't leave it to N.C.O.'s, you
				see, because, apart from anything else, they've
				had to make the N.C.O.'s out of privates; teach
				'em their job. So we're all backbone together.</p>

			<p>And when you hear some fellow saying "The
				men are splendid," you need not think he's just
				paying a conventional tribute or echoing a stereotyped
				kind of praise. It's true; "true as death,"
				as Harry Lauder used to sing; it's as true as anything
				I know. It's Gospel truth. The men are
				absolutely and all the time splendid.</p>

			<p>I'm not an emotional sort of a chap, and I'm
				sure before the war I never gave a thought to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
				things; but, really, there is something incurably
				and ineradicably fine about the rough average
				Englishman, who has no surface graces at all.
				You know the kind I mean. The decency of him
				is something in his grain. It stands any test you
				like to apply. It's the same colour all the way
				through. I'm not emotional; but I don't mind
				telling you, strictly between ourselves, that since
				I've been out here in trenches I've had the water
				forced into my eyes, not once, but a dozen times,
				from sheer admiration and respect, by the action
				of rough, rude chaps whom you'd never waste a
				second glance on in the streets of London; men
				who, so far from being exceptional, are typical
				through and through; just the common, low-down
				street average.</p>

			<p>That's the rough, rude, foul-mouthed kind, with
				no manners at all, and many ways that you hate.
				But I tell you, under the strain and stress of this
				savage existence he shows up for what he really is,
				under his rough, ugly hide: he's jewel all through
				without an ounce of dirty Boche meanness or
				cruelty in his whole carcass. You may hate his
				manners if you like but you can't help loving him;
				you simply can't help it if you work alongside of
				him in the trenches in face of the enemy.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

			<p>And that's not the only type we've got that
				makes you want to take your hat off to Tommy,
				and that puts a real respect, which perhaps the
				civilian doesn't understand, into your salutes.
				(It's only silly puppy boys, or officers who've never
				been in the presence of an enemy, or faced immediate
				danger with men, who can't be bothered
				properly and fully acknowledging salutes. You
				watch a senior, one who's learned his lessons in
				real service, and you'll find nothing grudging or
				casual or half-hearted. We get into the French
				way here, with a hint of the bow, a real salutation
				in our salutes.) Even more striking, I sometimes
				think, is the sterling stuff we find in types of men
				in the ranks who haven't naturally anything rough
				or hard about them: like my ex-draper chap, you
				know, in No. 3 Platoon, Ramsay. We've a
				number of the same calibre. He was a pillar of
				his chapel at home and&mdash;of all things&mdash;a draper:
				a gentle, soft-spoken dealer in ribbons and tape.
				I told you, I think, how he fought with a man in
				his section when he fancied he was not going to be
				allowed to go out one night with a bombing party.</p>

			<p>You read about calling for volunteers. With
				our lot it's hopeless to call for volunteers for a
				dangerous job. The only thing to do would be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
				call for volunteers to stay behind. The other
				thing's simply a way of calling out the whole
				Company; and if it happens to be just half a
				dozen you want, that's awkward.</p>

			<p>Then there's the matter of grousing&mdash;growling
				among themselves about this and that. You
				would be deceived about this until you got to
				know them a bit. It's a queer thing, and not
				easy to explain, but grousing is one of the passions
				of their lives, or, perhaps it would be truer to say, a
				favourite form of recreation. But, mark you this,
				only when everything is going smoothly, and there
				is nothing real to grumble about. It would seem
				to be absolutely forbidden to growl when there's
				anything to growl about; a sort of unwritten law
				which, since we've been out here, anyhow, is never
				transgressed.</p>

			<p>It's rather fine, this, you know, and very English.
				So long as there's a little intermittent grousing
				going on you can be quite sure of two things&mdash;that
				there's nothing wrong and that the men are in
				good spirits and content. If there's no grousing,
				it means one of two things&mdash;either that the men
				are angered about something, in which case they
				will be unusually silent, or that we are up against
				real difficulties and hardships involving real suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>ing,
				in which case there will be a lot of chaffing and
				joke-cracking and apparent merriment.</p>

			<p>Queer, isn't it? But I think it's a true description.
				If a long day's hard labour&mdash;clearing out a
				trench and building up a parapet, we'll say&mdash;is
				undone and washed out just as it's finished by a
				succession of Boche oil-cans, mortars, and general
				bombardment, which also lays out a few good men,
				and blows the next meal rations sky-high, so that
				there's the prospect of a long night's extra hard
				work where some rest had been expected, and all on
				an empty stomach&mdash;then you'll hear no grousing
				at all, but any number of jocular remarks:</p>

			<p>"I tell you, the Army of to-day's <i>all right</i>!"
				"We don't get much pay, but, my word, we <i>do</i> see
				life!" "Save me a lot o' trouble, this will. My
				fightin' weight was goin' up a lot too fast, but
				this'll save me givin' up my port wine an' turtle
				soup!" Then some wag pretends to consult his
				newspaper, and, looking up, announces that: "On
				the remainder of the Front the night was comparatively
				quiet." "Yes," says another, quoting
				further from the imaginary news, "and the banquet
				which had been arranged for 'A' Company
				was pos'poned till the following day." "When it is
				hoped," adds yet another joker, "that a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
				prominent Boche prisoners will attend." Elaborate
				winks and nods; and one man positively
				licks his lips as he mutters: "Gosh! If only they
				really <i>would</i> come over the sticks to-night; if
				only they would!" "Reg'ler bloomin' pacifist,
				isn't he?" remarks a student of the Press, "longin'
				to welcome the gentle Hun with open arms, he is&mdash;not
				'arf!" "We'll welcome him all right, if
				only the beggar 'd come. I'd like to use a section
				or two of 'em for buildin' up this bloomin' parapet.
				Be stiffer than these sand-bags full o' slush."
				"Shame! An' you a yewmanitarian, too. Why,
				how'd our poor chaps ever be able to stand the
				smell of all them potted Huns, an' so close, too?
				You're too harsh, mate; reg'ler Prussian, I call
				you."</p>

			<p>So it goes on. It's a bitter cold night. They
				are up nearly to their thighs in half-frozen slush.
				Their day's work has been entirely undone in half
				an hour, and has to be done over again without
				any interval for rest; and the supper ration's
				"gone West." You can hardly imagine what the
				loss of a meal means, with a night like that ahead
				of you, and occasional shells still dropping round
				the bit you must repair. They look awful ruffians,
				these chaps; caked all over with mud, hair and eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>brows
				and all; three or four days' stubble on their
				chins, and all kinds of ribaldry on their lips.
				They love their ease and creature comforts at
				least as much as any conscientious objector could;
				and God knows they are here as far removed
				from ease and creature comfort as men well could
				be&mdash;entirely of their own free will. And they
				will carry on all night, cracking their simple jokes
				and chaffing one another, and jostling each other to
				get to the front if one or two are required for anything
				extra dangerous. And the spirit that dictates
				their little jokes, isn't it as fine as any shown
				in bygone days by the aristocrats of France and
				England? If you told these fellows they were
				aristocrats, imagine how they'd take it! "'Ere,
				'op it! Not so much of it! Wotcher givin' us?"</p>

			<p>But aren't they&mdash;bless 'em! I tell you, when I
				come to compare 'em with the fellows we're up
				against across the way; with those poor devils
				of machine-driven Boches, with their record of
				brutish murder and swinishness in Belgium&mdash;why,
				there's not a shadow of doubt in my mind they are
				real aristocrats. The war has helped to make
				them so, of course. But, whatever the cause, they
				stand out, with the splendidly gallant <i>poilus</i> of
				France: true aristocrats&mdash;five hundred miles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
				'em from the North Sea to Switzerland, pitted
				against the deluded and brutalised, machine-driven
				Boches. There are no officers and machine
				driving our fellows, or the cheery, jolly French
				soldiers. Held back occasionally, directed always,
				they may be. There's no need of any driving
				on our side. Unquestioning obedience to an
				all-powerful machine may be a useful thing in its
				way. I know a better, though; and that's convinced,
				willing, eager determination, guided&mdash;never
				driven&mdash;by officers who share it, and share
				everything else the men have and do. And that's
				what there is all down our side of the line, from the
				North Sea to Switzerland.</p>

			<p>But, look here; I've just read through my last
				page, and it seems to me I've been preaching, ranting,
				perhaps. I'd better stow it and get on with
				my work. You see, one can't <i>talk</i> this kind of
				thing; and yet&mdash;I don't know, one feels it pretty
				often, and rather strongly. It's a bit of a relief
				to tell you something about it&mdash;in writing. Even
				to you, I probably shouldn't, by word of mouth,
				you know. One doesn't, somehow; but this sort
				of chatting with a pen is different. All I actually
				want to say, though it has taken such a lot of
				paper to say it on, is that the men really are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
				splendid. I love them. (It certainly is easier
				writing than talking.) I want you to know about
				it; to know something about these chaps&mdash;they
				come from every class of the community&mdash;so
				that you'll love 'em, too. I wish we could make
				every woman, and every man and child, too, in
				England understand how fine these fellows are,
				and how fine, really, the life they're leading is.</p>

			<p>For sheer hardness and discomfort there's
				nothing in the life of the poorest worker in England
				to compare with it. They are never out of instant
				danger. And the level of their spirits is far higher
				than you'd find it in any model factory or workshop
				at home. Death itself they meet with little
				jokes; I mean that literally. And the daily round
				of their lives is simply full of little acts of self-sacrifice,
				generosity, and unstudied, unnoted heroism,
				such as famous reputations are based upon in
				civil life in peace time. I feel I can't make it
				plain, as it deserves to be. I wish I could. But
				you must just accept it because I say it, and love
				'em all&mdash;the French as well as ours&mdash;because
				they've made themselves loved by your</p>

			<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="AN_UNHEALTHY_BIT_OF_LINE" id="AN_UNHEALTHY_BIT_OF_LINE"></a>AN UNHEALTHY BIT OF LINE</h2></div>

			<p>Rather to the general surprise, we have been
				moved into a new sector of the line, immediately
				south of what we called "our own." We have
				not been told why&mdash;the Olympians do not deal in
				whys and wherefores&mdash;but, according to gossip,
				we can take our choice between the wish to make us
				all familiar with the general lie of the land round
				here, to be the better prepared for a push; and the
				undoubted fact that a new Division is being moved
				into the line, and that our move southward facilitates
				this. Perhaps the real reason of the move
				is a mixture of both these; but, whether or no,
				the move itself provides striking evidence of the
				marked differences which exist between different
				parts of the line, and the extremely narrow and
				circumscribed nature of the knowledge one gets
				of the Front while serving in trenches.</p>

			<p>Our "B" Company is holding just now the subsection
				which actually adjoins the right of the
				sector we used to hold. We are on the right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
				"B," and "C" is on our right, with "D" back in
				the support line. Even "B's" bit, though it does
				adjoin our old beat, differs greatly from that;
				and our present short line is hemispheres away
				from the sector we knew before. There's not
				very much of it&mdash;about half the length of the line
				we last held&mdash;but what there is is hot and strong,
				I can tell you. The way in which "B" Company's
				bit differs is chiefly that it's in sandy soil, instead of
				all clay, and so is much drier and cleaner, more
				habitable in every way than anything we are
				accustomed to. But our bit, variously known
				as Petticoat Lane (why, I can't imagine), Cut-Throat
				Alley (obvious enough), and The Gut&mdash;well,
				our bit is, as "the Peacemaker" said directly
				he saw it, "very interesting." I think that's
				about the kindest thing you can say of it; and
				interesting it certainly is.</p>

			<p>To begin with, the greatest distance between
				any one spot in it and the Boche front line is
				seventy or eighty yards; and there's a place at
				which it's only half that. But the salient point in
				the whole sector is this: the half of our line that is
				seventy or eighty yards from the Boche line has
				between it and the Boche line a string of craters,
				the far lips of which are not more than fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
				to twenty paces from Fritz's sentries. These
				craters are sometimes occupied by the Boche
				and sometimes by us; but nobody attempts to
				hold them by day; they don't give shelter enough
				for that; and the betting as to who is to hold them
				on any given night is about even.</p>

			<p>You might almost say, "But why should anybody
				want to hold the beastly things?" And if
				you ever set foot in one of them, you'd say it
				with some feeling, for it's like trying to walk, or
				rather to crawl, in a bottomless pit of porridge.
				When dusk is coming on of an evening half a dozen
				of our bombers may start crawling from our
				parapet, making for the nearest crater. Maybe
				Fritz is dull and misses them. Maybe he opens
				such a hot fire they have to shin back quick. Maybe,
				just as we are getting close to the near edge of
				a crater, and flattering ourselves we've been a bit
				too nippy for the Boche this time, we get a rousing
				welcome from the crater itself, in the shape of three
				or four well-aimed bombs among us. Then those
				of us who are still able to think realise that the
				Boche has been a bit beforehand and got there
				first. Next night the process is reversed. During
				last night those confounded craters changed hands
				three times, remaining at last, I am glad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
				say, with us. We lost one man killed and two
				wounded. But we brought back two wounded
				and one dead Boche, and we reckon to have
				knocked out at least six others.</p>

			<p>It was a nightmare of a night, to tell the truth,
				but nothing big enough to get into dispatches.
				One point about the holding of these craters is
				that it enables you to lob bombs, or almost anything
				else for that matter, into the Boche front
				trench. Down here we really are learning something
				about oil-cans, mortars, and short range
				heavy stuff generally. It's very much hand-to-hand
				warfare, and, I suppose because of that,
				much more savage and more primitive than anything
				we've seen before. There practically isn't
				any No Man's Land here. It's just our trench
				and their trench and the muddy, bloody cock-pit
				between, all churned into a slushy batter by high
				explosives, and full of all manner of ghastly remains.
				Souvenirs! By Heavens! the curio hunters
				could find all they wanted here within a few
				yards of where I'm sitting, but not many of 'em
				would have the spunk to gather 'em in. You see,
				I haven't any great respect for the souvenir
				hunter. He seems a ghoulish sort of a creature to
				me, and I can't believe the cynical old "Peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>maker"
				when he says the bulk of them, and all
				the more inveterate sort, are women.</p>

			<p>The C.O. tells "the Peacemaker" he is so
				arranging things that no Company will get more
				than four days on end in Petticoat Lane, and then
				the other three days of the turn in trenches, in the
				support line, where Battalion Headquarters is.
				"A" Company, of course, takes glory to itself
				for having been the first to be sent in here, and I
				think this fully compensates them for the fact that
				nobody's had any rest worth speaking about since
				we got in. We shall probably do better in that
				respect when we have time to get used to the
				change. In fact, I can see a difference already in
				the men's attitude. But, mind you, the change is
				radical, from two hundred yards' interval between
				yourself and Fritz, down to fifty yards. It
				affects every moment of your life, and every mortal
				thing you do. More, it actually affects what you
				say. You don't make any telephonic arrangements
				about patrols and that sort of thing here.
				We are learning German at a great rate. But
				it was very startling to our fellows the first night,
				when they found they could hear voices in the
				enemy line. It seemed to bring Fritz and his
				ingenious engines very close indeed.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

			<p>But already the men have begun to crack their
				little jokes about it, and pretend to be careful
				about setting down a canteen of tea or a bit of
				bread lest one of "them bloomin' sauer-krauters
				lean over and pick it up before you can turn round&mdash;hungry
				blighters!" I confess I'm conscious
				that the nearness represents a great deal of added
				nerve strain; but, thank goodness, the men don't
				seem to feel it a bit. They're just as jolly as ever.
				But it is mighty intimate and primitive, you
				know.</p>

			<p>Imagine! The first thing I laid my hand on
				when I got into a crater on our first night, after
				we'd bombed Fritz out of it, was the face of a
				wounded Boche; and he bit my little finger to the
				bone, so that I had to have it washed and dressed
				by the M.O. for fear of poisoning. It's nothing;
				but I mention it as an instance of the savage
				primitiveness of this life at close quarters with
				the Boche.</p>

			<p>There's simply no end to his dodgy tricks here.
				Three or four of 'em will cry out for help from a
				crater&mdash;in English, you know&mdash;and pretend to be
				our own men, wounded and unable to move, or
				Boches anxious to give themselves up. And then,
				if anyone's soft enough to get over the parapet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
				to go and lend a hand, they open a hot fire, or
				wait till we get very near and then bomb. We had
				verbal warnings in plenty from the Company we
				relieved, but it's experience that teaches; and,
				whilst they may not be brilliant tricksters&mdash;they're
				not,&mdash;our fellows will at all events never allow the
				same trick to be worked off twice on us.</p>

			<p>By his fondness for all such petty tricks as these&mdash;and,
				of course, they have dozens of dirtier ones
				than this&mdash;the Boche has rather shut the door on
				chivalry. Given half a chance, the natural inclination
				of our men is to wage war as they would
				play cricket&mdash;like sportsmen. You've only to
				indicate to them that this or that is a rule of the
				game&mdash;of any game&mdash;and they're on it at once.
				And if you indicated nothing, of their own choice
				they'd always play roughly fair and avoid the
				dirty trick by instinct. But the Boche washes
				all that out. Generosity and decency strike
				him as simply foolishness. And you cannot
				possibly treat him as a sportsman, because he'll
				do you down at every turn if you do; and here in
				Petticoat Lane being done down doesn't only mean
				losing your money. As a rule, you haven't any
				of that to lose. It means&mdash;"going West for
				keeps"; that is, being killed. It's that sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
				thing that has made Petticoat Lane life savage
				and primitive; and the fact that it's so close and
				intimate as to be pressing on you all round all
				the time, that is what gives the additional nerve
				strain.</p>

			<p>It is, of course, a great place for little raids.
				The trenches are so close that you're no sooner out
				of your own than you're on top of theirs. And I
				take it as evidence of the moral superiority being
				on this side of the line, that we see very much more
				of their trenches than they ever see of ours. It
				is a great deal more difficult to repair trenches
				here than it was when we were a couple of hundred
				yards away from the enemy, because of the frequency
				of the oil-cans and bombs. The consequence
				is that, from the point of view of the cover
				they give, both our trenches and the Boches'
				are much inferior to those we had before. But,
				curiously enough, we have some very decent dug-outs
				here, deep and well protected.</p>

			<p>In fact, take it all round, we are not so badly
				off at all. And "interesting" the place most certainly
				is. ("The Peacemaker" generally means
				"dangerous" when he says "interesting.") There's
				something doing in the strafing line pretty nearly
				all the time; and strafing is a deal more interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
				than navvying, pumping, and mud-shovelling.
				The chances for little shows of one sort and another
				are more numerous here than where we were before.
				We've tried one or two already, and when we get
				back into the support line you shall have full
				particulars from your somewhat tired but quite
				jolly</p>

			<p>We were relieved in Petticoat Lane by "D"
				Company last night, and took the place they'd
				held in the support line; "a corner of Heaven
				itself," of course, after The Gut. And I have
				had a most luxurious and delightful day to-day,
				out of trenches altogether.</p>

			<p>Our O.C. "the Peacemaker"&mdash;you do remember,
				don't you, that the Officer Commanding the
				Battalion is the C.O., and the Officer Commanding
				the Company the O.C.: saves confusion&mdash;is an
				awfully good chap. He didn't say anything about
				it, but I feel sure he put me on my job of to-day&mdash;chose
				me for it&mdash;because he thought it would be
				good for me. He was ordered to send an officer
				to arrange about billets for the Company in &mdash;&mdash;
				ready for when we go out. Taffy's been a bit
				under the weather in Petticoat Lane, and is able
				to get a rest here in support. This meant rather
				more sticking to it for me in the front line, and, as
				a matter of fact, I didn't get an hour's sleep while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
				we were there. We had little strafes going most
				of the time, and I was rather cheap when we came
				out last night; bit shaky, you know; that's all.
				Two Boche mines were exploded in The Gut
				while we were there; both with extraordinarily little
				loss to us. But I was lifted out of the trench by
				one of 'em; and I suppose these things do indirectly
				affect one a bit, somehow, even when there is
				nothing to show for it; at all events, when they
				are combined with shortage of sleep.</p>

			<p>Anyhow, I'm as right as ninepence to-night, and
				had a fine sleep after midnight yesterday. And
				to-day, with "the Peacemaker's" horse for
				company, I've been playing the country gentleman
				at large and fixing up billets for the Company, and
				done pretty well for 'em, too. It was something
				of a race between Grierson of "D" and myself
				for the best officers' mess and sleeping quarters in
				&mdash;&mdash;; but Grierson hadn't much chance, really.
				He hasn't even my smattering of French, and his
				O.C. had not lent him a horse.</p>

			<p>The goodwife at the place I've got for ourselves
				is a torrential talker, and in rounding up the boys
				and girls working on her farm she shows a bit of
				a temper; but I'm certain she's a jolly capable
				manager, and she has promised to cook for us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
				which will mean a fine change from the batman's
				efforts in that line. Also the billets themselves
				are good, those for the men being the best I've
				seen anywhere: dry as a chip, and thoroughly
				sheltered from the wind. We shall be in clover
				for our week out, especially as I think &mdash;&mdash; is a bit
				too far back to admit of our being on trench
				fatigues at all while out.</p>

			<p>I did enjoy the pottering about on my own, and
				the nearest firing being three or four miles away
				all the time, made everything seem so extraordinarily
				peaceful after the roaring racket and
				straining watchfulness of Cut-Throat Alley; where
				one's eyes sort of ache from trying to look all
				ways at once, and one's ears and head generally
				get dead from the effort of recording the precise
				meaning of each outstanding roar in the continuous
				din. Also I met two or three interesting
				people, including the Town Major in &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

			<p>I had some grub about one o'clock in a big
				<i>estaminet</i>, almost a restaurant, really; and it was
				most interesting, after the trenches, to listen to
				the gossip and eat without feeling you had to
				look out for anything. There are a number of
				French residents left in this place, and this makes
				it different from the village we were last in, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
				behind the line, where the inhabitants have left,
				and the place is purely a camp, and partly in ruins
				at that. This place still has a natural human sort
				of life of its own, you know. And there are
				women in it, and a priest or two, and cows and
				sheep, and a town-crier, and that sort of thing&mdash;something
				fascinatingly human about all that,
				though it is within four miles of the firing line.</p>

			<p>The café was simply full of rumours and gossip.
				Military gossip is, of course, taboo with strangers
				and civilians, and rightly, since one cannot be sure
				who is and who is not a spy. But I suppose there's
				no harm in it among people who can recognise
				each other's uniforms and badges. Anyhow, I
				heard a lot to-day, which may or may not have
				anything in it.</p>

			<p>The things that interested me most were things
				about our own bit of front, and there were two
				definite reports about this. First, I heard that
				we are to throw out a new front-line trench to bridge
				the re-entrant south of Petticoat Lane. And then
				I heard we are to make a push to collar the Boche
				front line on the bend opposite us, because a few
				hundred yards of line there would mean a lot to us
				in the straightening of our front generally, and in
				washing out what is undoubtedly a strong corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
				for the Boche now, because it gives him some fine
				enfilading positions. If this were brought off it
				would wash out The Gut altogether as firing line,
				and that in itself would be a godsend. Also it
				would mean a real push, which is naturally what
				we all want. We think the fact of that extra
				Division having been fitted into our line rather
				endorses the report, and are feeling rather bucked
				in consequence. The whole Battalion, and for
				that matter the whole Division, is just spoiling
				for the chance of a push, and I doubt whether we've
				a man who wouldn't volunteer for the front line
				of the push at this moment, and jolly glad of the
				chance.</p>

			<p>I said in my last letter that I'd tell you about
				our little strafing stunts while we were in Petticoat
				Lane. But, really, this new prospect of a push
				and the report about the new front-line trench
				to be cut make them seem pretty small beer, and
				quite a long way off now, anyhow. You remember
				I told you there was a startling difference between
				the left of our present sector and the right of the
				one we were in before. It wasn't only the difference
				between clay and sand, you know. It was that,
				whereas the right of the old sector was hundreds
				of yards away from the Boche&mdash;as much as six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
				and seven hundred in parts&mdash;the left of the present
				sector runs down to sixty or seventy yards where
				it joins Petticoat Lane.</p>

			<p>That means a big re-entrant in the line, of course,
				and a part where our front runs almost at right
				angles to Fritz's, instead of parallel with it. The
				new trench would be to bridge the mouth of this
				re-entrant, and equalise the distance between our
				line and the Boche's, right along. Apart from
				anything else, it would make any subsequent
				push much easier. It's a low-lying, wet, exposed
				bit, that re-entrant; but this wouldn't matter if
				we were just going to use it as a jumping-off place,
				which is what we hope.</p>

			<p>However, as there's no official news, one mustn't
				think too much about it.</p>

			<p>It seems there's been some sickness at our
				Brigade Headquarters, which is a château marked
				large on the map, though out of sight from the
				Boche line. The sickness among the orderlies
				was attributed to something queer about the
				drains, and I suppose the thing was reported on.
				Anyhow, as the story I heard to-day goes, a
				tremendous swell arrived in a car to have a look
				at the place; an Olympian of the first water,
				you understand. No doubt I should be executed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
				by means of something with boiling oil in it if I
				mentioned his name. As he stepped from his car
				outside the château two shells landed, one on the
				lawn and one in the shrubbery. The Olympian
				sniffed at Fritz's insolence. Before he got into
				the doorway another shell landed very near his
				car, and spattered it with mud from bonnet to
				differential. The august one is reported to have
				greeted the Brigadier by saying rather angrily:</p>

			<p>"This is obviously a most unhealthy spot, sir;
				most unhealthy. Ought never to have been
				chosen."</p>

			<p>But a better yarn was the one a subaltern of the
				R.E. told me as I was jogging back to the trenches.
				This was about the sector next but one north of us.
				It seems a Boche 'plane was being chased by a
				British 'plane, and making heavy weather of it.
				The Englishman had perforated the other fellow's
				wings very badly, and partly knocked out his
				engine, too. Anyhow, the Boche 'plane was
				underdog, and descending rapidly midway between
				our front line and his own, right over the
				centre of No Man's Land. Naturally the men
				in the trenches on both sides were wildly excited
				about it. The story is they forgot everything
				else and were simply lining the parapets, yelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
				encouragement to their respective airmen as
				though they had front seats at Brooklands or the
				Naval and Military Tournament. Seeing this, a
				pawky old Scot&mdash;it was a Highland regiment on our
				side&mdash;slipped quietly down on the fire-step in the
				midst of the excitement, and began making accurate
				but leisurely target practice; carefully picking
				out Boches forty or fifty yards apart from each
				other, so as not to give the show away too soon.
				He did pretty well, but was bitterly disappointed
				when the Boche's Archibald forced our 'plane
				to rise, just as the Boche airman managed to jigger
				his machine somehow into his own support lines,
				and the spectators took cover.</p>

			<p>"Och, no a'thegither sae badly, surr," says
				Scotty to his Platoon Commander. "Ah managed
				to get nine o' the feckless bodies; but Ah
				hopet for the roond dizen!"</p>

			<p>Rather nice, wasn't it?</p>

			<p>Those little shows of ours in Cut-Throat Alley
				were practically all bombing, you know; but we did
				rather well in the matter of prisoners taken in the
				craters, and of Boches otherwise accounted for.
				Our own casualties for the four days were two
				killed&mdash;both in my Platoon, and both men with
				wives at home, I grieve to say; thundering good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
				chaps&mdash;and six wounded; two only slightly. We
				reckon to have got twenty or thirty Boches
				wounded, and at least ten killed; and there is no
				sort of reckoning needed about the eleven prisoners
				we certainly did take in the craters and sent
				blindfolded down to Headquarters. I believe
				this beats the record of the Company we relieved,
				which, of course, knew the place better; and our
				C.O. is pleased with us. I have to go now and
				tell off a small carrying party. Though feeling a
				bit shaky yesterday, I'm as right as right can be
				again now, so mind, you have no earthly reason to
				worry about your</p>

			<p class="right">
				"<i>Temporary Gentleman</i>."
			</p>

			<p>P.S.&mdash;"The Peacemaker" has just got word
				from Battalion Headquarters itself that it's
				perfectly correct about the new front-line trench
				to be cut; and it is believed "A" Company is to
				have something to do with it. So that's real news;
				and we feel sure it means a push to come. Everybody
				very cock-a-hoop.</p>

			<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="THE_NEW_FRONT_LINE" id="THE_NEW_FRONT_LINE"></a>THE NEW FRONT LINE</h2></div>

			<p>A turn out, a turn in, and now we're out again,
				and barring three Field Service post cards, I
				believe all that time has gone without my writing
				to you. You must try to forgive me. I can
				assure you things have been happening. There
				hasn't been much idle time. When I last wrote
				we had only begun to talk about the new front
				trench, hadn't we? Things certainly have hummed
				since then.</p>

			<p>The first move was a tour of inspection and
				survey of the proposed new line, by the O.C. of our
				Field Coy. of R.E., with some other officers.
				Somewhat to my surprise&mdash;I suppose he really
				ought not to expose himself to that extent&mdash;our
				C.O. accompanied this party. The next night,
				when the pegs were driven in, definitely marking
				the whole new line, the O.C.R.E. allowed me to go
				with him. The new line, as we marked it out,
				was 760 yards long; from down near The Gut
				right across to what used to be our centre, cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
				off the whole big re-entrant and equalising the
				whole sector's distance from the Boche.</p>

			<p>The next day our C.O. sent for O.C. Companies,
				and "the Peacemaker" took me along when he
				went, as I'd been over the ground, and he guessed
				the pow-wow would be about the new trench.
				The C.O. told us all about it, and what the ideas
				of the authorities were. He said it was the sort
				of job which might possibly prove costly in lives.
				But it had got to be done, and he was of opinion
				that if everyone concerned made up his mind
				never for a moment to relax the care and watchfulness
				he would use in the first half-hour, the job
				might be done with comparatively few casualties.
				He talked longer than he generally does, and I
				think he felt what he said a good deal. He said
				he never expected to have one moment's anxiety
				as to the bearing of any officer, N.C.O., or man of
				the Battalion in the face of danger. He knew
				very well we were all right on that score. But
				what he did want to impress upon us, as officers,
				was that our duty went a good deal beyond that.</p>

			<p>"I know very well that none of you would ever
				show fear," he said; "and I think you are satisfied
				that your N.C.O.'s and men will never fail you in
				that respect. But, remember, your greatest asset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
				is the confidence the men have in you. Never
				do anything to endanger that. If you use all the
				care and judgment you can, and if each one of
				your men understands exactly what the job before
				him is, and your influence is such as to prevent
				anyone from losing his head, no matter what
				happens, then the casualty list will be low. Every
				casualty you prevent on a job like this is as good
				as an enemy casualty gained. When we have to
				lose our men, let us lose them fighting, as they
				themselves would choose to go down if go down
				they must. But in this job of the new trench,
				we pit our wits and our coolness and discipline
				and efficiency against those of the Boche; and it's
				your job to see to it that the work is carried
				through at the minimum cost in man-power."</p>

			<p>He said other things, of course, but that was the
				gist of it, and I think we were all impressed. He's
				a martinet all right, is our C.O.; and, as you know,
				his tongue is a two-edged sword. He's as stern a
				man as I ever knew; but, by Gad! he's just, and,
				above and before all else, he is so emphatically
				a man.</p>

			<p>Well, the upshot of our plans was that "A"
				Company was to provide the covering party and
				be responsible for the tactical aspect of the show,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
				and "C" Company&mdash;all miners and farm workers&mdash;with
				one Platoon of "D," was to do the digging,
				for a start, anyhow. The R.E. were to run the
				wire entanglement right along the front of the new
				line, and this was to be the first operation. It was
				obvious that as much as possible must be done
				during the first night, since, once he had seen the
				job, as he would directly daylight came, the
				Boche might be relied on to make that line tolerably
				uncomfortable for anyone working near it
				without cover.</p>

			<p>While we were out of trenches that week our
				fellows were pretty busy during the first half of
				each night carrying material up to the front line.
				There was a good number of miles of barbed wire to
				go up, with hundreds of iron screw standards for
				the wire, and hundreds more of stakes; a lot of
				material altogether, and I am bound to say I
				think the R.E. arranged it very well. They had
				all their material so put together and stowed
				up at the front as to make for the maximum of
				convenience and the minimum of delay when they
				came to handle it in the open and under fire&mdash;as
				men always must be when doing anything in
				No Man's Land.</p>

			<p>Our men were bursting with swank over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
				Company's being chosen to act as covering party;
				delighted to think that what they regarded as the
				combatant side of the show was theirs. Indeed, I
				rather think a lot of 'em made up their minds that
				they were going to utilise the opportunity of having
				a couple of hundred men out close to the Boche
				trenches for a real strafe of the men in those
				trenches. "The Peacemaker" had to get 'em
				together and talk very seriously and straight
				about what our responsibilities were in this job.
				This was necessary to make the beggars realise
				that ours was a defensive and not an offensive
				stunt; in which success or failure depended mainly
				upon our ability to be perfectly silent.</p>

			<p>"All the scrapping will come later," said "the
				Peacemaker." "We mustn't invite one single
				bullet while we've a couple of hundred men behind
				us using picks and shovels, and working against
				time to get cover. If Boches come along our line,
				it will be our job to strafe 'em with our naked
				fingers if we possibly can. The last thing we'll
				do will be to fire a shot. And the one thing that
				must not happen, not in any case at all&mdash;no, not
				if the whole Prussian Guard turns out&mdash;is for a
				single Boche in any circumstances whatever to
				get through our line."</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

			<p>And that was the basis on which we tackled
				the job. Of course, the O.C. knew better than to
				try to handle his Company as a Company on the
				night. Orders could only be given in whispers,
				you understand. As a matter of fact, in all such
				work, as in night attacks, one must be able to
				rely, not alone on Platoon Sergeants and senior
				N.C.O.'s, but on Corporals and Section Commanders.
				And if they have not been trained so
				that you can rely on their carrying out instructions
				exactly, one's chances of success are pretty small.</p>

			<p>It was dark soon after five, and by a quarter to
				six we were moving out into the open. One and
				two Platoons went out down Stinking Sap, myself
				in command, and three and four Platoons went out
				from just a little way above Petticoat Lane. I led
				my lot and "the Peacemaker" led the other half-Company,
				the idea being that when he and I met
				we should know that we were in our right position,
				and could stay there. We moved with about
				three paces' interval between men, and kept three
				or four connecting files out on our inside flank
				and a couple on the outer flank; the business of
				the inside men being to steer us at an average
				distance of forty paces to the front of the foremost
				line of pegs, which was the line to be followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
				by the barbed-wire entanglements; the line of the
				new trench itself being well inside that again.</p>

			<p>This meant that one flank of our line, just above
				Petticoat Lane, would rest within 150 yards of the
				Boche front trench, and the other flank about 225
				yards. We had drilled the whole business very
				carefully into the men themselves, as well as the
				Section Commanders and Sergeants. We got out
				on our line without a sound; and then "the Peacemaker"
				made his way back to Stinking Sap to
				report to Captain &mdash;&mdash;, of the R.E., that we had
				taken on the duty of protection and were all ready
				for his men to go ahead. He marched his carriers
				out then, stringing them out along the whole
				line, and the whole of his Company set to work
				putting up the screen of wire entanglements behind
				our line.</p>

			<p>This whole business has given me a lot of respect
				for the R.E.; a respect which, I think, is pretty
				generally felt throughout the Service. The way
				they planned and carried out that wiring job was
				fine. No talk and no finicking once they were in
				the open; every last peg and length of binding
				wire in its right place; sand-bags at hand to fold
				over anything that needed hammering; every
				man told off in advance, not just to make himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
				as generally useful as he could, but quite definitely
				to screw in standards, or drive in stakes, or fix
				pegs, or carry along the rolls of wire, or strain the
				stays, or lace in the loose stuff, as the case might
				be. Every man knew precisely what his particular
				part was, and went straight at it without a word
				to or from anyone.</p>

			<p>Meanwhile, I was working carefully along from
				end to end of our line, checking up the intervals,
				altering a man's position where necessary, and
				making sure that all our men were properly in
				touch and keeping their right line, watching out
				well and making no sound. Nobody in our lot
				moved, except the officers. All the others lay
				perfectly still. We kept moving up and down in
				front the whole time, except when flares were up
				or machine-gun fire swept across our way, and then,
				of course, we dropped as flat as we could.</p>

			<p>But no machine-gun spoke on that sector, not
				once while the wire was going up. Before half-past
				seven "the Peacemaker" came along to me
				with orders to lead my men off to Stinking Sap.
				The wiring was finished. There had been a
				hundred and fifty men at it, and at that moment
				the last of 'em was entering Stinking Sap&mdash;casualties,
				nil.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

			<p>"The Peacemaker" marched his half-Company
				round the end of the wire above Petticoat Lane,
				and I took mine round the end in front of Stinking
				Sap-head. Then we wheeled round to the rear
				of the new wire entanglement and marched out
				again, immediately in rear of it, till "the Peacemaker"
				and I met, as we had previously met in
				front. So we took up our second and final position
				and got down to it exactly as we had done in the
				first position.</p>

			<p>When the O.C. reported that we were in position,
				"C" Company marched out, half from each
				end of the line, under their own officers, but with
				the O.C.R.E. in command, and his officers helping.
				They were at three yards' interval. There was a
				peg for every man, and the first operation was for
				each man to dig a hole in which he could take
				cover. It had all been thought out beforehand,
				and every man knew just what to do. Their
				instructions were to dig as hard as ever they knew
				how, but silently, till they got cover. All the
				sections were working against each other, and the
				O.C. Company was giving prizes for the first,
				second, and third sections, in order of priority,
				to get underground.</p>

			<p>We couldn't see them, of course, and had all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
				occupation we cared for, thank you, in looking
				after our line. I was glad to find, too, that we
				could only hear them when we listened. They
				were wonderfully quiet. It's a wet clayey soil,
				and they had been carefully drilled never to let
				one tool touch another. I am told they went at
				it like tigers, and that the earth fairly flew from
				their shovels. In our line there wasn't a sound,
				and every man's eyes were glued on his front.</p>

			<p>The evening had been amazingly quiet, nothing
				but desultory rifle fire, and unusually little of
				that. At a quarter to nine a Boche machine-gun
				dead opposite the centre of my half-Company
				began to traverse our line&mdash;his real objective, of
				course, being, not our line, but the line of trench,
				the old fire trench, in our rear. I know now that
				at that moment the slowest of "C's" diggers was
				underground. That burst of fire did not get a
				single man; not a scratch.</p>

			<p>A fine rain, very chilling, began to fall, and got
				less fine as time went on. The wind rose a bit,
				too, and drove the rain in gusts in our faces. By
				good luck it was coming from the Boche trenches.
				At half-past ten they sent over ten or twelve
				whizz-bangs, all of which landed in rear of our
				old front line, except two that hit its parapet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
				Rifle fire was a little less desultory now, but nothing
				to write home about. They gave us an occasional
				belt or two from their machine-guns,
				but our men were lying flat, and the diggers were
				below ground, so there was nothing to worry about
				in that.</p>

			<p>By half-past eleven I confess I was feeling
				deuced tired. One had been creeping up and
				down the line for over five hours, you know; but it
				wasn't that. One spends vitality; it somehow oozes
				out of you on such a job. I never wanted anything
				in my life so much as I wanted to get my half-Company
				through that job without casualties.
				And there was one thing I wanted even more than
				that&mdash;to make absolutely certain that no prowling
				Boche patrol got through my bit of the line.</p>

			<p>Down on our flank at The Gut there were half a
				dozen little bombing shows between six and midnight,
				and one bigger scrap, when the Hun exploded
				a mine and made a good try to occupy its crater,
				but, as we learned next day, was hammered out of
				it after some pretty savage hand-to-hand work.
				Farther away on the other flank the Boche artillery
				was unusually busy, and, at intervals, sent over
				bursts of heavy stuff, the opening salvoes of which
				rather jangled one's nerves. You see, "A"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
				Company could have been extinguished in a very
				few minutes had Boche known enough to go about
				it in the right way.</p>

			<p>If only one enterprising Boche, working on his
				own&mdash;a sniper, anybody,&mdash;without getting through
				our line just gets near enough to make out that it is
				a line, and then gets back to his own trenches, our
				little game will be up, I thought. It wasn't
				restful. The men were getting pretty stiff, as
				you may guess, lying still in the wet hour after
				hour.</p>

			<p>At half-past two "the Peacemaker" came along
				and whispered to me to take my men in: "Finished
				for to-night."</p>

			<p>I wasn't sorry. I put my senior Sergeant on to
				lead, and myself brought up the rear. I was, of
				course, the last to get into Stinking Sap, and my
				Platoon Sergeant was waiting for me there to tell
				me that not one of our men had a scratch, nor yet
				a single man of "C" Company. One man of No.
				3 Platoon, in "the Peacemaker's" half-Company,
				had a bullet through his shoulder; a Blighty, and
				no more. And that was our record.</p>

			<p>But, look here, I absolutely must stop and
				censor some of the Platoon's letters before turning
				in. I'll write again as soon as ever I can and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
				you the rest of it. But&mdash;a trench nearly 800

			<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="A_GREAT_NIGHTS_WORK" id="A_GREAT_NIGHTS_WORK"></a>A GREAT NIGHT'S WORK</h2></div>

			<p>In my last letter I think I told you all about our
				first night's work on the new trench; how it was
				cut, and the wire entanglements run out, between
				six in the evening and half-past two in the morning;
				and the casualty list just one man wounded! It
				may not seem much to you, but to us it seemed
				almost miraculous. I think the powers that be
				would have been quite pleased with us if we had
				managed it with, say, thirty or forty casualties.</p>

			<p>Two and a half hours or so later, round about
				five o'clock, although you would have thought we
				should all be pretty tired, as no doubt we were
				(though not so tired, I fancy, as we mostly felt at
				midnight), everyone was interested in turning out
				for the morning Stand-to. We were all anxious
				to watch Mr. Boche's first glimpse of our night's
				work; not that we could see the expression on the
				faces of the Germans or hear their comments;
				but we could imagine a good deal of it, and wanted
				to see just what happened, anyhow.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

			<p>A few sentry groups had been posted along the
				new line when we came in from it at half-past two;
				but these were withdrawn at the first glimmerings
				of coming dawn, since we could watch the front as
				closely from the original fire-trench, and it was
				possible, of course, that Fritz might just plaster
				the new line with shrap. and whizzes and so on as
				soon as he clapped eyes on it.</p>

			<p>I was watching before the first greying of the
				dawn, from a sniper's post pretty close to the
				Boche line down near the beginning of Petticoat
				Lane. The first thing I made out in the Boche
				line, when the light was still only very faint, was
				the head of a sentry raised well above the parapet
				level, as he stared out at the nearest bit of our
				new wire. I turned half round and grabbed a rifle
				from a man in the trench, but the Boche had disappeared
				when I looked round again. Then the
				idea struck me, "Perhaps he'll bring an officer to
				look; a sergeant, anyhow." So I drew a very
				careful bead on that spot, and got my rifle comfortably
				settled on a mud rest.</p>

			<p>Sure enough, in a couple of minutes that sentry's
				head bobbed up again in the same spot. I held
				my fire, waiting, on the officer theory. And, next
				moment, another head rose beside the sentry's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
				and came up a good deal less cautiously. I won't
				swear to its being an officer because I couldn't see
				well enough for that. But I think it very likely
				was. Anyhow, I had him most perfectly covered
				when I fired, and they both disappeared the instant
				I had fired, and never showed up again, so I am
				certain I got the second one. He was visible
				down to about his third tunic button, you see, and
				with a resting rifle, I don't think I could miss at
				that range. It wasn't more than 120, if that;
				sights at zero, of course.</p>

			<p>It really was rather thrilling, you know, that
				Stand-to. We had all our machine-guns ready,
				and traversed Fritz's parapet very thoroughly.
				Upon my word, in the fluster of that first daylight
				minute or two, with the new wire under his nose,
				I believe Fritz thought we were going to make a
				dawn attack. I never saw so many Boches expose
				themselves. As a rule, they are a good deal better
				than we are in the matter of keeping out of sight;
				they take far fewer chances. But they didn't
				seem able to help looking this time, and our sniper
				did pretty well. So did the machine-guns, I
				think; I don't see how they could have helped it.</p>

			<p>Then Boche got his machine-guns to work, and
				poured thousands of rounds all along our front&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
				regular machine-gun bombardment, for which he
				got precisely nothing at all, none of our people
				being exposed. But can't you imagine the excitement
				in the Boche line? The evening before they
				had seen our line exactly as usual. In the night
				they had apparently heard and suspected nothing.
				And now, with the first morning light, they saw a
				line of brand-new wire entanglement and a new
				trench line, that must have looked most amazingly
				close to them, and actually was in parts an advance
				of 400 yards from the old line. And then
				the length of it, you know&mdash;just on 800 yards. It
				certainly must have startled 'em.</p>

			<p>We quite thought they'd start lambasting Old
				Harry out of the new line at any moment; but
				they didn't. I guess they had sense enough to
				conclude that we had nobody out there. But
				during the forenoon Master Boche registered on
				the new line at several points; about twenty
				rounds of whizzes and H. E., just to encourage us
				with regard to our work for that night, I suppose.
				And beyond that he didn't go&mdash;dignified silence,
				you know. But I bet he was pretty mad to think
				of all he'd missed during the night. In the afternoon
				Fritz sent a couple of 'planes up, I dare say
				with cameras, to get a record of the new line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
				But our Archibalds in the rear made it so hot for
				them I don't think they can have got any snap-shots.</p>

			<p>When "A" Company filed out at six o'clock
				that night to take up protective duty along the
				new wire, as before, while the new trench was
				proceeded with, I think we might have been excused
				for feeling a bit creepy. I can't say how the men
				felt, but I confess I had made up my mind that my
				own chances of getting back were tolerably thin.
				One must move about a good bit to do one's job
				properly, and keep touch with a hundred men
				strung out over 300 yards of ground in pitch darkness.
				As a matter of fact, it was barely dark
				when we filed out. We daren't leave it a minute
				later, in case a strong Boche patrol should have
				worked inside our line, and been waiting for the
				working party when it came out with bombs. We
				simply had to be beforehand with 'em; and there
				was no getting away from the fact that the Boche
				had had all day in which to study this new line
				of ours and make his plans. I say I don't know
				how our men were feeling. I do know they were
				cracking little jokes themselves about it before
				we left the sap.</p>

			<p>"This way for motor ambulances!" "Change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
				here for Blighty and the Rest Cure!" "Where'll
				you have yours, matey?" I heard plenty of
				remarks like that as I worked my way down
				Stinking Sap to get to the head of my lot before
				we moved out.</p>

			<p>"You'll be all right," said one of mine to a "C"
				Company man as he entered the sap. "Mister
				blooming Fritz can't get at you with 'A' Company
				out in front, you take it from me. We'll
				twist his tail properly if he does come." The
				"C" men were for digging again, you know.</p>

			<p>It's impossible for an officer to feel shaky, however
				slight his experience, when he has men like
				ours to work with.</p>

			<p>It wasn't exactly a proper trench that "C"
				Company went to work in that night. There were
				bits that were almost finished; and then, again,
				there were other lengths where it was only a chain
				of holes, linked together by bits a yard or two
				long, in which the surface had been shifted, just to
				mark out the trace of the new line. But every
				man was able to get into cover right away, even
				in the worst bits, because of these holes, and then,
				being in a hole, his job was to cut his way along into
				the next hole just as quick as his strength would
				allow him. The trench was cut narrow, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
				know; not a quarter the width of the old trenches
				we have occupied. This doesn't make for comfort
				in getting to and fro; but it does give far safer
				cover from every kind of projectile, and especially
				from the deadly shrap. and the slippy whizz.</p>

			<p>While "C" slogged away at making connection
				right through, we lay out by the wire, as we had
				done the night before, and I crept up and down our
				line. There was no rain, and the night was so
				quiet that we could hear every little move among
				the diggers much more plainly than on the night
				before. I wondered if the Boches could hear it.
				They sent us little bursts of machine-gun fire
				now and again, such as they send throughout
				every night; and there was the normal amount of
				rifle fire and the normal number of flares and
				different kinds of lights going up from the enemy
				lines. Our men all lay as still as mutton, and
				when the lights rose near our way, or the M.G.
				fire came, I naturally kept very still.</p>

			<p>Once I distinctly made out a figure moving very
				slowly and cautiously outside the wire. I should
				like to have fired, and, better still, to have been
				able to get quickly and silently through the wire
				and on to that moving figure, getting to grips, as
				we did with that German sniper not long since,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
				without a sound. But there was no opening in
				the wire near; and with regard to firing, my orders
				were not to draw fire by expending a single round
				unnecessarily, and to fire only in defence. What
				I did was to get the O.C.'s permission shortly
				afterwards to take three men and patrol beyond
				the front of the wire. But we found nothing. No
				doubt I had seen one member of a Boche observation
				patrol on the prowl to find out what we
				were doing; and if only I could have got him
				it would have been excellent. From that time
				on we kept a continuous patrol going in front
				of the wire.</p>

			<p>Then came a salvo of four whizz-bangs, all
				landing fairly near the new trench; three in rear of
				it, and one most infernally close in front of us. I
				suppose we all told ourselves the ball was just
				about to begin. But nothing happened for over
				an hour. Then came nine shells in quick succession,
				one of which, on my left, robbed my half-Company
				of four men, one killed and three
				wounded. The rest accomplished nothing. Then
				silence again, followed by occasional bursts of
				M.G. and the usual sort of rifle fire. Corporal
				Lane, of No. 2 Platoon, stopped a M.G. bullet
				with his left shoulder, I regret to say, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
				man in the trench&mdash;"C" Company&mdash;was killed
				by a bullet through the head.</p>

			<p>With every little burst of fire, one braced oneself
				for the big strafe that we naturally felt must
				come. It seemed the Boche was playing with us
				as a cat plays with a mouse. "I wonder what
				devilry he's got up his sleeve?" We probably
				all asked ourselves that question fifty times.</p>

			<p>At two o'clock there wasn't a break anywhere in
				the new line. It was a connected trench throughout,
				and nowhere less than six feet deep, with two
				communicating trenches leading back to our
				original front line. At three o'clock the word
				came along that the working party had been
				withdrawn, and that I was to take my men in.
				As before, we left a few sentry groups, to be
				relieved at dawn by fresh sentries, since the new
				line was now to be guarded by day and manned
				by night.</p>

			<p>And that was the end of it. I got my men
				safely in. Half an hour later the Boche sent over
				another ten or dozen shells on the new line, and
				once again before dawn he did the same, with the
				usual periodical bursts of M.G. fire and dropping
				rifle fire during the rest of the time. And nothing
				more. Wasn't it extraordinary, when he had had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
				a whole day to think about it, and must have
				known we should be at work there that night?
				Possibly, however, in his crafty way, he assumed
				we should not go near the new line that second
				night for fear of strafing, and held his hand for
				that reason. And, possibly, our General assumed
				he'd think that, and acted accordingly. But
				there it is. We got our work done at next to no
				cost.</p>

			<p>I was going to tell you about the rumours as to
				our push to straighten out the line, but my time's
				up. That will have to wait for my next letter.
				We are having an easy time now, but there were
				no free minutes last week. You'll hear again
				soon, from your</p>

			<p>You are quite right in saying that I don't feel
				much interest in political affairs at home these
				days. The fact is, we do not often see the newspapers,
				and when we see them there isn't much
				time for really reading them or giving much consideration
				to what they say. The war news is
				interesting, of course; but all this endless talky-talky
				business, why, I can hardly tell you how
				queerly it strikes us out here. You see, we are
				very close to concrete realities all the time, and to
				us it seems the talky-talky people are most amazingly
				remote from realities of any kind. They
				seem to us to be very much interested in shadows,
				notions, fads, fancies, and considerations of interests
				which we think were washed out of existence at
				the very beginning of the war. They even seem
				able to strive mightily and quarrel virulently over
				the discussion of the principles and abstractions
				involved in things they propose to do when the
				war is over!</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

			<p>M-m-m-m-m-m! Seems to us the thing is to get
				it over, and in the right way. No, we are not
				much interested in the political situation. The
				tangible actualities of the situation out here
				seem to us very pressing; pressing enough to
				demand all the energies and all the attention;
				every atom of the strength of all the people of
				the British race; without any wastage over more
				remote things, abstractions, things <i>ante</i> and <i>post
					bellum</i>. Here in France I can assure you men,
				women, and children are all alike in that they have
				no life outside the war. Every thought, every act,
				everything is in and for the war. The realities
				are very close here.</p>

			<p>One thing in that last letter of yours especially
				pleases me. "We have now got to the point in
				England at which all the people of both sexes
				who are worth their salt are busy at war work of
				one kind or another."</p>

			<p>That's excellent. Well, now rope in the ones
				who are not "worth their salt." You'll find they're
				all right, once they're roped in. I don't believe
				in this idea of some people not being worth their
				salt; not in England, anyhow. The stock is too
				good. You know the type of hoodlum who, with
				licks of hair plastered over his forehead, seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
				spend his days leaning against a lamp-post. The
				fellow I mean has a perfectly beastly habit of spitting
				over everything in sight; when riding on top of
				a 'bus, for instance. Despised by decent men, he's
				a real terror to decent women. Same type, I
				suppose, as the Apache of Paris. Every big
				city breeds 'em.</p>

			<p>Well, all I want to tell you about this gentleman
				is, never to run away with the notion that he can't
				be worth his salt. All he needs is to be taught
				the meaning of authority. It's only a matter of
				months; even weeks. With my own eyes I have
				watched the process at work. Nobody will ever
				again be able to delude me about it. In a country
				like ours there are no people "not worth their
				salt." The worst type of man we've got only
				needs a few months in a Battalion like ours, during
				the training period, to learn the meaning of
				authority, and, by means of discipline, to have his
				latent manhood developed. It's there all right.
				Only he'll never develop it of his own accord.
				Authority must be brought to bear. The Army
				method is the quickest and best. In a few months
				it makes these fellows men, and thundering good
				men at that. Worth their salt! They're worth
				their weight in&mdash;well, to take something real and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
				good, say in 'baccy and cartridges&mdash;real men and
				real fighters.</p>

			<p>Out here in billets, we get a deal more information
				about things generally than ever reaches us
				in the line. All the rumours come our way, and
				among 'em, here and there, I dare say, hints of
				the truth. We know that out there in the new
				trench we cut no dug-outs are being made. There's
				no evidence of any intention to inhabit that new
				front line. It is just fully manned by night and
				held by a few sentry groups in the day. (It's a
				deuce of a job getting along it by night when it's
				full of men. Being kept so narrow, for safety's
				sake, there are not many places where you can
				pass men, so you have to get along somehow over
				their heads or between their legs. Oh, it's great
				going on a wet night!) And this, in our eyes, is
				proof positive of the truth of the rumour which
				says we are to use it almost immediately as a
				jumping-off place, in a push designed to strengthen
				and straighten our front line by cutting off that
				diabolical corner of the Boche line opposite The
				Gut; to wash out The Gut, in fact, altogether,
				putting it behind our front line, with all its blood-soaked
				craters.</p>

			<p>I don't think I ought to write much about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
				though I suppose the Censor won't mind so long as
				I mention no places or names to indicate the part
				of the front we're on. But, in effect, if we can
				take several hundred yards of Boche trenches
				here, the gain to us, apart altogether from strategic
				considerations, will be equivalent to at least a
				mile. It's much more than just that, really,
				because it means getting a very advantageous
				and commanding position in exchange for a very
				exposed and deadly one, depriving Boche of a
				great advantage and gaining a great advantage
				for ourselves. Even the lesser of the two possible
				schemes, concerning less than 200 yards of Boche
				front, would give us all that. But the general
				opinion seems to be that we are to tackle the
				larger scheme, involving the seizure of a good
				mile or more of Boche front. We all think
				we know, and we none of us know anything,
				really.</p>

			<p>But I must clear out. We have a new issue of
				improved gas-helmets, and I've got to see to
				dishing 'em out. Then every man will have two
				anti-gas helmets and one pair of anti-lachrymatory
				gas goggles. We are also renewing our emergency,
				or "iron," ration&mdash;and that all looks like a push,
				and is therefore exhilarating.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

			<hr class="tb" />

			<p>
				<i>Later.</i><br />
			</p>

			<p>Great and glorious news! The push is a fact. I
				mustn't say which day, and, just in case this letter
				fell into wrong hands, I think I'll hold it back, and
				not post just yet. The main thing is we are to
				push; and we are jolly well going to wipe out that
				Boche corner. It is the lesser of the two schemes&mdash;a
				local affair pure and simple, so I suppose you'll
				learn next to nothing about it from dispatches.
				You know our British way in the matter of official
				dispatches. The British have no shop window
				at all. One ought to be glad of it, I suppose.
				Ours is the safer, better, more dignified way, no
				doubt, and certainly never raises hopes doomed
				to possible disappointment. At the back of my
				mind I approve it all right. (Which should be
				comforting to the G.O.C. in C.) But, as touching
				ourselves, one cannot help wishing the dispatches
				would give you news of our show. Of course
				they won't.</p>

			<p>"The night was quiet on the remainder of the
				Front." "Some elements of trenches changed
				hands in the neighbourhood of &mdash;&mdash;, the advantage
				being with us." That's the sort of thing. At
				least, I hope it'll read that way. It will, if "A"
				Company can make it so.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

			<p>I'm particularly glad we had that turn in Petticoat
				Lane, you know. Now that I think we shall
				never occupy it again as a front line&mdash;by the time
				you get this, please the pigs, it'll be well behind our
				front line, and we'll be snugly over the rise where
				the Boche now shelters&mdash;I don't mind admitting
				to you that it's a heart-breaking bit of line. There's
				no solid foothold anywhere in it, and there's
				next to no real cover. It's a vile bit of trench,
				which we never should have occupied if we'd had
				any choice in those early days when the Boche
				first dug himself in opposite, and the French,
				having no alternative, scratched in here. For
				our sins we know every inch of it now, and, thanks
				to good glasses and long hours of study, I think I
				know the opposite lines pretty well&mdash;the lines I
				hope we shall be in.</p>

			<p>Our fellows are queer, you know. Perhaps I've
				told you. Any kind of suffering and hardship they
				have to endure they invariably chalk up to the
				account against Mr. Boche. There's a big black
				mark against him for our spell in Petticoat Lane,
				and, by Jupiter! he'll find he'll have to pay for
				every mortal thing our chaps suffered there; every
				spoiled or missed meal; even lost boots, sore feet,
				and all such details. Our chaps make jokes about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
				these things, and, if they're bad enough, make
				believe they almost enjoy them while they last.
				But every bit of it goes down in the account against
				Fritz; and if "A" Company gets the chance to be
				after him, by Gad! he'll have to skip! He really
				will.</p>

			<p>I'm not going to risk giving away military information
				by telling you any more now. It will all
				be over, and Cut-Throat Alley will be behind us
				when next I write. And, understand, you are
				not to worry in the least bit about me, because I
				promise you I'll get through. I should know if I
				were not going to; at least, I think I should. But
				I feel perfectly certain we shall bring this thing off
				all right anyhow; and so, even if I did chance to
				go down, you wouldn't grieve about that, would
				you? because you'd know that's the way any fellow
				would like to go down, with his Company bringing
				it off; and, mind you, a thing that's going to make
				a world of difference to all the hundreds of good
				chaps who will hold this sector of the front before
				the war's over.</p>

			<p>We've got a mighty lot to wipe out in this little
				push. It isn't only such scraps of discomfort as
				we suffered, nor yet the few men we lost there.
				But, French and British, month in and month out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
				for many a long day and night, we've been using
				up good men and true in that bloody, shell-torn
				corner. Why, there's not a yard of its churned-up
				soil that French and English men haven't
				suffered on. We've all that to wipe out; all that,
				and a deal more that I can't tell you about. I'll
				only tell you that I mean to get through it all right.
				Every man in the Battalion means real business&mdash;just
				as much as any of the chaps who fought under
				Nelson and Wellington, believe me. So, whatever
				you do, be under no sort of anxiety about your</p>

			<p class="right">
				"<i>Temporary Gentleman.</i>"<br />
			</p>

			<p>P.S.&mdash;Seeing that you and I, and all our lot,
				never have known anything about military matters
				before this war came, I think it may interest you, as
				it interests me, to know that I have never seen the
				Company as a whole jollier, or in higher spirits
				than it is with this job before it; and, do you
				know, I never felt happier myself, never. I feel
				this makes it worth while to be alive and fit;
				more worth while than it ever was in civil life
				before the war.</p>

			<p>Perhaps this address will be quite a shock to you
				if you know what it means. So I hasten to say
				that I am perfectly all right, really. "Clearing
				Station"&mdash;perhaps that won't have the ominous
				look to you that "Hospital" would, though it
				means the same thing. But the point is, I am all
				right. I told you I'd get through, and I have.
				The fact that I'm lying in bed here&mdash;in luxurious
				comfort&mdash;is only an incident. I am quite safe
				and perfectly all right.</p>

			<p>They tell me here that directly an officer is
				wounded information to that effect is sent home to
				his people. Well, I hope you will get this word
				from me first, and accept my assurance that there's
				nothing to worry about. These good folk here
				will put me as right as ninepence in no time, and I
				hope very shortly to be back with the Company
				and in the new line.</p>

			<p>It was shrapnel, you know, and got me in the
				left leg and a bit in the right arm just when I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
				most wanting the use of both of 'em. I hope they
				haven't told you I'm going to lose my leg or
				anything, because I'm not. The surgeon here&mdash;a
				first-rate chap and a splendid surgeon&mdash;has told
				me all about it, and my leg will very soon be as
				good as ever.</p>

			<p>This is just a line to let you know I am perfectly
				all right. I'll write and tell you all about it to-morrow.</p>

			<p>I wonder whether the dispatches will have told
				you anything. The push was splendid. We've
				got that corner, and The Gut is well behind our
				front line now.</p>

			<hr class="tb" />

			<p>My letter of yesterday will have assured you
				that I am all right; nothing at all to worry about.
				I meant to have written you fully to-day about the
				push. But we've been busy. The surgeon's been
				cleaning me up&mdash;getting rid of useless souvenirs,
				you know; and it seems I'm better keeping pretty
				still and quiet to-day. Shall be out and about all
				the quicker, you see. This is a perfectly heavenly
				place, where you don't hear a vestige of gun-fire,
				and everything is sweet and clean, quiet and easy;
				no responsibility, no anything but comfort and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
				ease. What a luxurious loaf I'm having! I'll
				write to-morrow.</p>

			<hr class="tb" />

			<p>I'm going ahead like a house afire; but so confoundedly
				lazy, you'd hardly believe it. I suppose
				this pencil will be legible, though it hardly looks
				it to me. As I say, I'm too lazy for words; simply
				wallowing in comfort and cleanliness. Thought I
				would just pencil a line now, so that you would
				know I was perfectly all right and then I can write
				properly to-morrow.</p>

			<hr class="tb" />

			<p>Another lazy day. I really ought to be at work,
				you know, so well and fit I am. But I just laze
				in this delightful bed, and watch the busy orderlies
				and sisters flitting to and fro, as though I were in
				a dream and other folk had to do all the world's
				work. The good old "Peacemaker" has come in
				to see me, and is writing this for me; chiefly because
				of my laziness, and partly that I like to spare you
				the work of deciphering the hieroglyphics I make
				with my left hand. The right arm is pretty good,
				you know, but it seems I'll get it entirely sound
				again rather quicker by not using it just now; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
				it's rather jolly to have one's O.C. Company
				working for one in this way.</p>

			<p>He says that while I was about it I was a duffer
				not to get a real Blighty, and so have a holiday
				and come and see you all. As a fact, I've no
				doubt he's profoundly grateful that he will not
				be robbed of my invaluable services for long.
				"A" Company was relieved last night by a
				Company of the &mdash;&mdash;; in our new trenches, you
				know; the trenches that used to belong to Mister
				Boche; so our fellows are having a bit of a rest,
				I'm glad to say. Not the luxurious rest I'm
				having, of course; but something to be going on
				with.</p>

			<p>I meant to tell you a whole lot of things, but
				for the laziness that makes me so greedy for naps
				and dozes. Also, they say visitors have to leave
				now, and "the Peacemaker" has a good way to
				ride. I'll write properly to-morrow. Meantime
				"the Peacemaker" is good enough to say he
				will write you to-night particulars as to how
				I got my scratches; so I won't ask him to
				write any more now. He will carry this on
				himself when he gets back to-night&mdash;while I
				laze and sleep.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

			<hr class="tb" />

			<p>As promised, I am adding a few lines to this
				for our good friend. I have not yet told him, but
				as a fact I am the only unwounded officer in "A"
				Company at the moment, and we were relieved
				last night in order that we might reorganise.
				Lieutenant Morgan&mdash;"Taffy"&mdash;was killed, I
				grieve to say, in the beginning of the advance, and
				our casualties for the Company were thirty-two
				killed and seventy-eight wounded. It's a terrible
				price, of course, but you will understand that a big
				loss was inevitable in our Company, when I tell
				you that we not only led the advance, but led it
				from the notorious Petticoat Lane, where the front
				is extraordinarily difficult to cross. We were
				very proud to be chosen for the lead, and compared
				with the net gain for the line, our loss is
				small, really. Indeed, if the entire casualties in
				the whole advance are weighed up against the
				position won, I believe I am right in saying that
				the cost was remarkably low. The gain in the line
				is immense, and there is not the smallest chance of
				the Boches taking it back again. Although our
				bombardment knocked his trenches about pretty
				badly&mdash;they were very strong trenches indeed,
				to begin with, very strongly placed and favourably
				situated&mdash;since our occupation we have worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
				day and night to make of the corner practically
				a fortified position, and one from which we can
				punish the Boche pretty severely on both flanks.
				I think this gain will lead to other gains before
				long in this sector. Our information is that the
				Boche casualties were very heavy. However, I
				did not mean to run on like this with regard to
				the military aspect. It is our friend you will want
				to hear about.</p>

			<p>Now, in the first place, I should like to be
				allowed to say what you perhaps have guessed:
				that he is a very fine and a very valuable officer.
				I am not a bad judge, not only because I command
				his Company, but because, unlike himself, I am
				not quite without military knowledge of the kind
				that came before the war, having a good many
				years behind me of service as a Volunteer, and
				then as a Territorial, down to within seven months
				of the beginning of the war when I joined this
				Service Battalion. And I have no hesitation in
				saying that our friend is a fine and valuable officer.
				I know that a big share of any credit due for the
				fine training and discipline of our Company&mdash;which
				is, I think, admitted to be the crack Company
				of the best Battalion in the Brigade&mdash;is due,
				not to me, but to the Commander of our No. 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
				Platoon. It is a very great loss to me to have him
				laid aside now; but I am so thankful his life is
				spared that I have no regret to waste over his
				being wounded. But I do very sincerely hope
				that he will be able to return to us, to the reorganised
				"A" Company, for I have never met an
				officer I would sooner have beside me. The men
				of the Platoon, and, indeed, of the whole Company,
				are devoted to him; and I regard it as little short
				of marvellous that in so comparatively short a time
				a man who had never had even the slightest hint
				of military training should have been able to
				become, all round, so efficient, so well posted
				technically, and, above all, so confident and absolutely
				so successful a leader of men. For that
				has been his greatest asset: that his men will go
				anywhere with him, do anything for him, trust
				him without the slightest reserve or doubt.</p>

			<p>You know more about his character than I do,
				but I venture to say that the character you know
				has been wonderfully developed by the war and
				by his military training. He may have been the
				most lovable of men before, but I cannot believe
				that he was anything like so strong a man or so
				able a man. Confidence, fearlessness, decisiveness&mdash;strength,
				in fact; these qualities, I am sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
				have developed greatly in him since he joined. I
				sometimes think there is nothing more wonderful
				in all this wonderful period of the war than the
				amazing development it has brought in the
				thousands of young Englishmen who now are
				capable and efficient officers, loved and trusted
				by their men, and as able in every way as any
				officers the British Army ever had, although
				the great majority of them have no military tradition
				behind them, and before August, 1914, had
				no military training. That is wonderful, and I am
				convinced that no other race or nation in the wide
				world could have produced the same thing. The
				men, fine as they are, might have been produced
				elsewhere, or something like them. But this
				apparently inexhaustible supply of fine and efficient
				officers&mdash;no, I think not.</p>

			<p>The newspapers will have told you something
				of our little push, and I will not trouble you with
				any technical detail. We advanced over a very
				narrow front after a short but intense bombardment.
				Our friend led the right half of "A"
				because I did not want to rob his own Platoon of
				his immediate influence. His is No. 1. The pace
				was hot, despite the torn and treacherous nature
				of the ground. The right half did even better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
				my half, and stormed the first Boche line with extraordinary
				dash and vigour. It seemed as though
				nothing could stop their impetuosity; and in the
				midst of the tremendous din I caught little waves
				of their shouting more than once.</p>

			<p>Our friend had crossed the first line, and successfully
				led his men to the very edge of the second
				line, shouting to his men to join him in taking it,
				when the shell burst that brought him down. The
				same shell must have laid some Boches low, if that
				is any consolation. Not that we need any consolation.
				I feel sure you will agree with me in
				that.</p>

			<p>But I want to tell you that the wounds in the
				right arm&mdash;not serious, I am thankful to say&mdash;were
				not from the same shell. They came in the
				neighbourhood of the first Boche line. That same
				right arm (after it was wounded), carrying a
				loaded stick, knocked up a Boche bayonet that
				was due to reach the chest of a man in No. 1
				Platoon and then served to support the same
				man on the parapet of the Boche trench&mdash;he was
				already wounded&mdash;for a few moments till a
				stretcher-bearer got him. It was not possible
				for our friend to stay with him, of course. A few
				seconds later he was leading his men full pelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
				towards the second line; and all that after his first
				wound. I thought you would like to know that.
				Our C.O. knows it, and I venture to hope it will
				find mention in dispatches.</p>

			<p>And now with regard to his condition. Whilst
				he is not quite so forward as he thinks&mdash;there is,
				of course, no question of his coming back to duty
				in a few days, as he fancies&mdash;there is, I think, no
				cause whatever for anxiety. In fact, the M.O. at
				the Clearing Station assured me of so much. His
				general health is excellent; nothing septic has intervened;
				it is simply a question of a little time. The
				worst that is likely to happen is that the left leg
				may be permanently a shade shorter than the
				right, and it is hoped this may be averted. His
				Company&mdash;all that is left of us&mdash;will be very
				sincerely glad to see him back again. Meantime
				we rejoice, as I am sure you will, in the manner,
				the distinction, of his fall, in the certainty of his
				enjoying the rest he has earned so well, and in the
				prospect of his recovery.</p>

			<p>The Battalion being now out of the line, the O.C.
				Company has kindly sent my batman along to
				me here&mdash;you remember my batman, Lawson, on
				Salisbury Plain&mdash;and he is writing this for me, so
				that I can preserve my present perfect laziness. I
				point this out by way of accounting for the superior
				neatness of the handwriting, after my illegible
				scrawls. Lawson was a clerk at &mdash;&mdash;'s works
				before the war, and, as you perceive, has a top-hole
				"hand of write."</p>

			<p>I got rather a fright, as I lay dreaming here,
				half awake and half asleep, at six o'clock this morning.
				An orderly came along with a blue ticket and
				a big safety-pin, like those the Highlanders use in
				their petticoats, and pinned his label on the bottom
				of my counterpane.</p>

			<p>"Hallo!" says I; "what's this? Are they
				putting me up for sale?"</p>

			<p>Mentally, I began to describe myself for the
				catalogue. (How strong are the habits of civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
				life!) "One full-size, extra heavy Temporary
				Officer and Gentleman; right arm and left leg
				slightly chipped, the whole a little shop-worn, but
				otherwise as new. Will be sold absolutely without
				reserve to make room for new stock." (They
				have to keep as many beds as possible vacant in
				Clearing Stations, you know.)</p>

			<p>The orderly just grinned and faded away like
				the Cheshire cat. A Sister came along shortly
				afterwards, and I asked her the meaning of my
				blue label.</p>

			<p>"Oh! that," she said, very casually, "that's the
				evacuation card."</p>

			<p>I am to be evacuated, like a pulverised trench, a
				redoubt that has become useless or untenable.
				Jolly, isn't it? Seriously, I was a good deal worried
				about this, until I had seen the M.O., because
				I had an idea that once one was evacuated out of
				the Divisional area, one was automatically struck
				off the strength of one's unit, in which case, goodness
				knows when, if ever, I should see my own
				"A" Company again. But the M.O. tells me it's
				all right, so long as one remains in France. One
				is only struck off on leaving France, and when
				that happens one can never be sure which Battalion
				of the Regiment one will return to. So there's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
				nothing to worry about. It's only that these
				Clearing Stations have to keep plenty of vacant
				accommodation ready for cases fresh out of the
				line; and so fellows like me, who are supposed to
				require a bit more patching up than can be given
				in two or three days, have to be evacuated to one
				or other of the base hospitals. Hence the label,
				which makes of your Temporary Gentleman an
				"evacuation case."</p>

			<p>It's uncertain when I shall be moved, or to which
				base, so I cannot give you a new address for letters.
				The generosity, the kindness, the skill, and the
				unwearying attentiveness and consideration shown
				one in this place could not possibly be improved on;
				but their official reticence in the matter of giving
				one any information regarding one's insignificant
				self, future movements, and so on, can only be
				described as godlike. I shall always associate it
				in my mind with a smile of ineffable benevolence
				(also rather godlike), as who should say, with
				inexhaustible patience, "There, there, my little
				man; there, there." And that's all. Perhaps
				it's good for us, taken, as medicine must be, with
				childlike trust and faith. We must hope so.</p>

			<p>Come to think of it, there is a hint in the gentle
				air of this place&mdash;never torn by shot or shell, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
				penetrated by even the faintest odour of defunct
				Boches in No Man's Land&mdash;of a general conspiracy
				of reticence. It has infected mine own hitherto
				trusted batman (who presumes to chuckle as he
				writes these lines at my dictation), whose professed
				ignorance, regarding most points upon which I
				have this morning sought information, suggests
				that I have in the past consistently overrated
				his intelligence and general competence. It is
				clearly very desirable that I should get back to
				my Platoon as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>Lying here at mine ease, I think a great deal;
				but of the quality of my thinking I fear there is
				little to be said that is favourable. Perhaps the
				medicine I take so trustfully has contained some
				of the soporific stuff of dreams, and that is why
				the pain in my leg has been so trifling since the
				first day here. I feel my thoughts stirring in my
				mind; but they move in a swaying, dreamy fashion,
				as though they were floating in, say golden syrup,
				and were not really interested in getting out of it.
				I wanted to tell you all about our push, but, do
				you know, though it was not very many days ago,
				it seems already extraordinarily remote, so far as
				the details are concerned, and I am hazy as to
				what I have told you and what I have not told.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

			<p>One thing stands out so clearly in my otherwise
				treacly mind that I feel I never, never shall forget
				it; and that is the sensation of the moment when
				the order reached us to advance. We had been
				a long time waiting for it, even before our bombardment
				began, and when it came&mdash; But,
				although the sensation is very clear to me, I'm
				not at all sure I can convey any idea of it to you.
				I've just asked Lawson what he felt like when it
				came; but the conspiracy of reticence, or something,
				leads him to say he doesn't know. I found
				myself muttering something at the moment, and
				he says he did, too. That's something of a coincidence.
				He believes the actual words he muttered
				were: "What ho!" But that's not exactly
				illuminating, is it?</p>

			<p>I believe my thought, as we scrambled over the
				parapet was that now, at last, we were going to
				wipe Petticoat Lane off the map as a front line.
				Good-bye to this hole! That was the idea, I
				think. We did so hate that bit of line, with its
				quicksand craters in front, and the sodden lowness
				that made it a sort of pocket for the receipt of
				every kind of explosive the Boche liked to lob in
				on us.</p>

			<p>The struggle through the craters, before we got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
				to the first Boche line, was pretty beastly, and, I
				am afraid, cost us rather dear, although we got to
				the near lip of the craters before the punishment
				began, thanks to a quick start and the fine accuracy
				of our gunners in their curtain fire. You know the
				sort of thing that happens in nightmares, when
				each of your feet weighs a ton and a half, at the
				moment when speed is the only thing to save you
				from the most hideous kind of spiflication. Getting
				through the craters was like that.</p>

			<p>Our good time began when the craters were
				passed, and there was nothing but Boche trenches
				in front of us. Then it was we began to feel
				the jolly feelings you've read about; the glorious
				exhilaration of the charge. And, really, it
				wouldn't be possible to exaggerate about that.
				You can take it from me that the most highly
				coloured chromo-lithographs can't overdo that, in
				the essential spirit of the thing. Their detail is
				pretty groggy, of course&mdash;no waving plumes, gay
				colours, flashing swords, and polished top-boots,
				you know. My goodness, no! We were all the
				colour of the foul clay we'd come from&mdash;all over.
				But the spirit of it! It's perfectly hopeless
				for me to try to tell you, especially in a letter.
				They say they pump spirits and drugs into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
				Boches before they leave their trenches. No drug
				and no champagne, even of the choicest, could have
				given us any more exhilaration, I fancy, than one
				felt in that dash from the craters to the first Boche
				line. Heavens! but it was the real thing; real, real,
				real; that's what it was, more than anything else.
				Made you feel you'd never been really and fully
				alive till then. Seven-leagued boots, and all that
				kind of thing, you know. The earth seemed to
				fly under your feet. I can see the dirty, earth-smeared
				faces in that Boche trench now. (They
				were scuffling and scrambling out from the dug-outs,
				where they'd sheltered from our bombardment,
				to their fire-steps.) They seemed of no
				more importance than so many Aunt Sallies or
				Dutch dolls. Things like that to stop <i>us</i>! Absurd!</p>

			<p>And how one whooped! I was fairly screaming
				"'A' Company!" at the very top of my voice as
				we jumped into that trench. The man on my
				left was Corporal Slade (Lance-Sergeant, I should
				say) and, as we reached their parapet I could hear
				him yelling beside my ear, through all the roar of
				the guns: "Hell! Give 'em hell! Give 'em
				hell, boys!" Most outrageous!</p>

			<p>In the trench it was a sort of a football scrum
				glorified; oh! very much glorified. Most curiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
				the thing passing through my mind then was "the
				Peacemaker's" old gag, apropos of the use of his
				trench dagger, you know: "When you hear that
				cough, you can pass on to the next Boche. Get
				him in the right place, and three inches of the steel
				will do. Don't waste time over any more." Queer
				wasn't it?</p>

			<p>Galloping across the next stretch&mdash;by the way, it
				was the very devil getting out over the Boche
				parados, so high and shaly. A fellow grabbed
				my right ankle when I was half-way up; the very
				thing I'd always dreaded in dreams of the trenches,
				and, by Gad! if I didn't kick out you must let
				me know about it. I'd sooner have had a bayonet
				thrust any day than the ram of my field boot that
				chap got in his face. The next stretch, to the
				Boche second line, yes! The champagney feeling
				was stronger than ever then, because one felt that
				front line was smashed. Sort of crossing the
				Rhine, you know. One was on German soil,
				so to say. My hat, what scores to pay!</p>

			<p>And mixed up with the splendid feeling of the
				charge itself&mdash;by long odds the finest feel I ever
				had in my life&mdash;there was a queer, worrying little
				thought, too. I knew some of our men were
				dropping, and&mdash; "Damn it, I ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
				doing something to save those chaps." That
				was the thought. It kind of stung; sort of feeling
				I ought to have some knowledge I had failed to
				acquire. They're your men, you ought to know.
				That sort of feeling. But I don't think it slowed
				one's stride at all. The champagne feeling was
				the main thing. I was absolutely certain we were
				bringing it off all right. The Boche guns were
				real enough; but their men didn't seem to me
				to count.</p>

			<p>Queer thing about the wire in front of that second
				line. It wasn't anything like so good or extensive
				as front-line wire, and I dare say our guns had
				knocked a good deal of the stuffing out of it.
				Still, there was a lot left, more than I expected
				for a second line. Do you know, "A" Company
				went through it as though it had been paper.
				It was a glorious thing that. You know how
				gingerly one approaches barbed wire or anything
				like that; a thorn hedge, if you like. And you've
				seen how fellows going into the sea to bathe, at
				low tide, will gallop through the rows of little
				wavelets where the water's shallow; feet going
				high and arms waving, the men themselves
				whooping for the fun of the thing. That's exactly
				how our chaps went through that wire. I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
				guarantee nobody felt a scratch from it. And yet
				my breeches and tunic were in ribbons from the
				waist down when I got to the field ambulance, and
				from the waist to the knee I'll carry the pattern of
				that wire for some time to come. Might have
				been swan's-down for all we knew about it.</p>

			<p>And then, unfortunately, on the parapet of the
				second line I got my little dose, and was laid out.
				Goodness knows, that shell certainly laid out some
				Boches as well as me. I'll say this for 'em, they
				met us on the parapet all right. But "A" Company's
				business was urgent. We had scores to
				settle from Petticoat Lane and other choice spots;
				and the Kaiser's got no one who could stop us.
				I do wish I could have seen it through. I know
				they tried hard to counter us out of that line.
				But they couldn't shift old "A," who did just as
				well when I dropped out as before&mdash;the beggars!
				Lawson tells me I was yelling like a madman on
				that parapet for some time before I went to sleep,
				you know: "I'll be there in a minute!"&mdash;there
				in a minute! How absurd!</p>

			<p>Next thing I knew I was being lifted out of a
				trench stretcher, right away back at Battalion
				Headquarters in the old support line. Then the
				good old Batt'n M.O. prodded around me for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
				bit, and gave me a cigarette, I remember. I
				remember hearing him say: "Oh! well, <i>you're</i> all
				right." And then I must have had another doze.</p>

			<p>Next thing I remember I was lying in a right-hand
				lower stretcher in a motor ambulance, and
				soon after that I was in bed in the Field Ambulance
				at &mdash;&mdash;. The same night I came on here, the Field
				Ambulance being pretty busy and full up. It's
				only a few miles off. I know there was snow all
				round when I was being lifted out of the motor
				ambulance into the hall here.</p>

			<p>And then comfort, and cleanliness and quiet;
				most wonderful peace, and English nursing sisters.
				My goodness, aren't English nursing sisters lovely?
				English women, all of 'em, for that matter. And
				they say there are still some men at home who
				don't want to join! Seems queer to me.</p>

			<p>Well, Lawson is rapidly developing writer's
				cramp, and I don't wonder at it.</p>

			<p>And so I'm to move on somewhere else soon
				from here. In any case, you understand, don't
				you, that I'm all right, wanting for nothing,
				and most kindly looked after. I'll write again
				very soon, and whatever you do, don't have the
				smallest feeling of anxiety about your</p>

			<p>This is to be evacuation day. A dozen officers
				and nearly a hundred other ranks are to leave this
				place to-day for one or other of the bases. The
				life of a permanent official in one of these Clearing
				Stations must be curious, handling as he does a
				never-ending stream of the flotsam and jetsam
				of the great war. The war knocks chips off us,
				and as we are broken we stream in through the
				hospitable portals of this beautifully organised
				and managed place; are put in plaster of Paris,
				so to say, and off we go again to another place to
				be further doctored; the more newly chipped
				arriving by one gate, as we go trickling out by
				another. And this process is continuous. Along
				the British front alone a score or more of men are
				bowled over every hour. In a place like this the
				process is brought home to one.</p>

			<p>So, too, is the ordered precision and efficacy of
				the system of dealing with the wreckage. It is
				wonderfully methodical and well thought out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
				And over all, as I told you before, broods the
				spirit of benevolent reticence, which makes one
				feel a little like a registered parcel entrusted to
				a particularly efficient postal service. "When are
				we going?" Benevolent smile. "Presently; presently."
				"What base are we going to?" Benevolent
				smile. "You'll see by and by." "About
				how long shall we be on the journey?" Benevolent
				smile. "Oh! you'll be made quite comfortable
				on the journey. Don't worry about that."
				"Well, I'm very much better this morning,
				don't you think?" Benevolent smile. "Do you
				think I shall be able to sit up in a day or two?"
				Benevolent smile. "We shall see."</p>

			<p>So it is always. I dare say the thirst of patients
				for information often becomes very trying to the
				authorities. But they never in any circumstances
				show any impatience. They never omit the
				benevolent smile. And they never, never, for one
				instant, relax the policy of benevolent reticence;
				never. The man next to me is very keen about
				his temperature; it is, I believe, the chief symptom
				of his particular trouble. But the bland familiar
				smile is all the reply he can ever get to his most
				crafty efforts to ascertain if it is higher or lower. I
				haven't the slightest doubt it is all part of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
				carefully devised policy making for our benefit;
				but I wouldn't mind betting the man in the next
				bed sends his temperature up by means of his
				quite fruitless efforts to ascertain that it has gone
				down.</p>

			<p>Here's another strange handwriting for you.
				The present writer is Lieut. R&mdash;&mdash;, whose left
				arm has had a lot more shrap. through it than
				my right got, and who has kindly lent me the
				services of his right. My left-handed writing is
				still, as you will have noted, a bit too suggestive
				of a cryptogram in Chinese. We are lying opposite
				one another in very comfortable bunks in the
				Red Cross train, making from &mdash;&mdash; to a base, we
				don't yet know which. There are nearly 500
				"evacuation cases" on board this train. Its progress
				is leisurely, but I believe we are to reach our
				destination round about breakfast time to-morrow.
				We found books and magazines in the train when
				we came on board. That's a kindly thought,
				isn't it? They bear the stamp of the Camps
				Library. The doctors and nurses get round
				among us on the train just as freely as in hospital.
				The whole thing is a triumph of good management.</p>

			<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

			<p>While we were lying in our stretchers waiting for
				the train, having arrived at the station in motor
				ambulances from the Clearing Station, we saw miles
				of trains pass laden with every conceivable sort of
				thing for the French firing line; from troops to
				tin-tacks; a sort of departmental store on wheels;
				an unending cinematograph film, which took over
				an hour to roll past us, and showed no sign of
				ending then. All the French troops, with their
				cigarettes and their chocolate, had kindly, jovial
				greetings for the stretchered rows of our chaps as
				we lay in our blankets on the platform waiting for
				our train, especially the jolly, rollicking Zouaves.
				Good luck, and a pleasant rest; quick recovery, and&mdash;as
				I understand it&mdash;return to the making of glory,
				they wished us, and all with an obviously comradely
				sincerity and play of facial expression,
				hands and shoulders, which made nothing of
				difference of language. And our chaps, much
				more clumsily, but with equal goodwill, did their
				level best to respond. I think the spirit of their
				replies was understood. Yes, I feel sure of that.
				The war's a devastating business, no doubt; but
				it has introduced a spirit of comradeship between
				French and English such as peace could never
				give.</p>

				<i>Next morning.</i><br />
			</p>

			<p>You will forgive the left-handedness of the
				writing, won't you? My friend opposite has had
				a good deal of pain during the night, and I cannot
				ask him to write for me now. It was a strange
				night, and I don't think I'll ever forget it, though
				there's really nothing to tell; "Nothing to write
				home about," as the men say. I didn't sleep
				much, but I had quite a comfortable night, all the
				same, and plenty to think about. When the
				train lay still between stations, as it sometimes
				did, I could hear snatches of talk from different
				parts of the train itself&mdash;doctors, nurses, orderlies,
				patients, railway officials, and so on. Then
				perhaps another train would rumble along and
				halt near us, and there would be talk between
				people of the two trains: French, English, and the
				queer jumble of a patois that the coming together
				of the twain in war has evolved. Also, there was
				the English which remains English, its speaker not
				having a word of any other tongue, but which
				yet, on the face of it, somehow, tells one it is
				addressed to someone who must understand it
				from its tone or not at all.</p>

			<p>"Oh, that's it, is it? Cigarettes? You bet.
				Here, catch, old chap! Bong, très bong Woodbine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
				What ho! Same to you, old chap, an' many of
				'em. Yes, yes; we'll soon be back again, an' then
				we'll give the blighters what for, eh? Chocolate,
				eh? Oh, mercy, mercy! No, no; no more; we
				got plenty grub; much pang, savvy. You're a
				brick, you are. You bong, très bong; compree?
				Hallo! Off again! Well, so long, old sport!
				Good luck! Bong charnce! See ye 'gain some
				time! Bong sworr!"</p>

			<p>There's a poor chap in the bunk under mine
				who's been delirious most of the night. He looks
				such a child. A second lieutenant of the &mdash;&mdash;s;
				badly shaken up in a mine explosion, and bombed
				afterwards. The M.O. says he'll get through all
				right. He's for Blighty, no doubt. Odd, isn't
				it? This time to-morrow he may be in England,
				or mighty near it. England&mdash;what an extraordinary
				long way off it seems to me. There have
				been some happenings in my life since I was in
				England; and as for the chap I was before the war,
				upon my word, I can hardly remember the fellow.
				Pretty sloppy, wasn't he? Seems to me I must
				have been a good deal of a slacker; hadn't had
				much to do with real things then.</p>

			<p>We know at last where we're bound for; in fact,
				we're there. The train has been backing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
				filling through the streets of the outskirts of
				Havre for the last half-hour or more. But last
				evening, when I was writing, we could only ascertain
				that we were going to &mdash;&mdash;. Benevolent
				smiles, you know.</p>

			<p>It's frightfully interesting to see the streets.
				I see them through the little narrow flap at the
				top of my window that's meant to open. It
				seems quite odd to see women walking to and
				fro; and row after row of roofs and windows, all
				unbroken. No signs of shell-shock here. But
				on the other side of the train, nearest the harbour,
				one sees acres and acres of war material; I mean
				really acres and acres of rations, barbed wire,
				stores of all kinds.</p>

			<p>There's a sort of bustle going on in the train. I
				think we must be near the end, so I'll put my notebook
				away.</p>

			<hr class="tb" />

			<p>
				10.45 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span><br />
			</p>

			<p>We are in what they call the Officers' Huts, on
				some quay or another. It's a miniature hospital
				or clearing station, built of wood, and very nicely
				fitted up. Sitting-room at one end, then beds,
				and then baths and cooking-place and offices; all
				bright and shining and beautifully clean, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
				Red Cross nurses, doctors, orderlies, and no end
				of benevolent smiles. They've taken our temperatures
				and fixed us up very comfortably, and somebody's
				started a gramophone, and I've just had
				a cup of the glutinous, milky stuff I used to hate,
				you remember. I don't hate such things nowadays;
				not really, you know; but I pretend I don't
				care much about 'em for the sake of the virtuous
				glow it gives to take 'em.</p>

			<p>Everyone has asked everyone else where we are
				going next, and everyone has been given benevolent
				smiles and subsided into a Camps Library
				magazine or book. The sitting-up cases are
				pottering about in the sitting-room, where there
				are basket chairs and the gramophone. I can see
				them through the open door. The nurses have
				fixed jolly little curtains and things about, so
				that the place looks very homely. I gather it's a
				sort of rest-house, or waiting-place, where cases
				can be put, and stay put, till arrangements have
				been made for their admission into the big hospitals,
				or wherever they are to go. We have all
				been separately examined by the Medical Officer.
				My arm is so much better, I think it must be
				practically well. I don't know about the leg. I
				asked the M.O.&mdash;an awfully decent chap&mdash;to try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
				to arrange things for me so that I should not be
				cut adrift from my own Battalion, and he said he
				thought that would be all right.</p>

			<hr class="tb" />

			<p>
				3.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span><br />
			</p>

			<p>I'm for Blighty. The M.O. came and sat on my
				bed just now and told me. He certainly is a
				decent chap. He said the Medical Board had no
				hesitation at all about my case, and that I was to
				cross to England to-night. But he said I need not
				worry about my Battalion. He was awfully good
				about it; and he's giving me a letter to a brother of
				his in London. He thinks I shall be able to get
				back to my own Battalion all right, and he thinks
				I shall be ready for duty much quicker by going
				right through to Blighty than by waiting here. But
				what do you think of it? Fancy going to Blighty;
				and to-night, mind you! I'd never dreamt of it.
				And what about poor old "A" Company? It's a
				queer feeling. We've all been sorted out now;
				the goats from the sheep. I suppose it's a case
				of the worst-chipped crockery for Blighty, and
				the rest for tinkering here. But I can't help
				thinking a week, or two, at the outside, will put
				me right.... Here come Army Forms to be
				signed.</p>

			<p>In bed on board the Red Cross ship. All
				spotless white enamel and electric light, and spotlessly-aproned
				nurses, just as in hospital. I've
				just been dressed for the night; clean bandages and
				everything comfortable. From the last benevolent
				smile I elicited I shouldn't be surprised if we
				weighed anchor round about midnight; but I
				may be quite wrong. Anyhow, I feel remarkably
				comfortable. I think there must have been
				something specially comforting in the medicine
				I had when my bandages were changed. I shall
				sleep like a top. I don't think I've quite got the
				hang yet of the fact that I am actually bound for
				Blighty. But there it is; I'm on the ship, and I
				suppose it's on the cards I may see you before
				this scribble of mine can reach you by post. In
				which case, it seems rather waste of time writing at
				all, doesn't it? I think I'll go to sleep. I haven't
				slept since the night before last. That boy I told
				you of who was bombed, after being in a mine
				explosion, is sleeping like an infant in the next
				cot but one to mine. Nice-looking chap. I'm
				glad he's sleeping; and I bet somebody will be
				glad to see him in Blighty to-morrow. To-morrow!
				Just fancy that!</p>

				<i>Next day.</i><br />
			</p>

			<p>To-day's the day. When I woke this morning I
				had glimpses, as the ship rose and fell, of a green
				shore showing through the portholes on the far
				side of the deck. That was the Isle of Wight.
				Had a magnificent sleep all night; only opened my
				eyes two or three times. We were rather a long
				time getting in. Then came Medical Officers of
				the Home Service; and with surprisingly few
				benevolent smiles&mdash;not that they lack benevolence,
				at all&mdash;I learned that I was for London.
				It hardly seemed worth while to write
				any more, and I could not get off the ship to
				send a wire.</p>

			<p>Now I am in a Red Cross division of an express
				train bound for Waterloo. I'll send you a wire
				from there when I know what hospital I am for.
				Shan't know that till we reach Waterloo. Meantime&mdash;that's
				Winchester we've just passed. Old
				England looks just the same. There is a little
				snow lying on the high ground round Winchester.
				It looks the same&mdash;yes, in a way; and in another
				way it never will look just the same again to me.
				Never just the same, I think. It will always
				mean a jolly lot more to me than it ever did before.
				Perhaps I'll be able to tell you about that when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
				we meet. I find I can't write it. Queer
				thing, isn't it, that just seeing these fields
				from the windows of a train should bring the
				water to one's eyes? Very queer! One kind
				of sees it all through a picture of the trenches,
				you know.</p>

			<p>"The Old Peacemaker" didn't tell me, but I
				know now that nearly half "A" Company are
				casualties; and there's a good many "gone West."
				Poor Taffy's gone. Such a clever lad, Taffy.
				My Platoon won't be quite the same again, will
				it? Platoon Sergeant, one other Sergeant, two
				Corporals, and a lot of men gone. We were in
				front, you see. Oh! I know there's nothing to
				grieve about, really. Petticoat Lane's behind
				our front now, thank goodness. That'll save
				many a good man from "going West" between
				now and the end of the war.</p>

			<p>I'm not grieving, but it makes a difference, just
				as England is different. Everything must be
				different now. It can't be the same again, ever,
				after one's been in the trenches. If Germany
				wants to boast, she can boast that she's altered
				the world for us. She certainly has. It can never
				be the same again. But I think it will be found,
				by and by, she has altered it in a way she never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
				meant. Of course, I don't know anything much
				about it; just the little bit in one's own Brigade,
				you know. But it does seem to me, from the
				little I've seen, that where Germany meant to
				break us, she has made us infinitely stronger
				than we were before. Look at our fellows! Each
				one is three times the man he was before the war.
				The words "fighting for England" had next to no
				meaning for me before August, 1914. But now!
				that's why these fields look different, why England
				can never again look the same to me as it did
				before. I know now that this England is part of
				me, or I'm part of it. I know the meaning of
				England, and I swear I never did before. Why,
				you know, the very earth of it&mdash;well, when I
				think how the Boche has torn and ravaged all
				before him over there, and then think of our
				England, of what the Hun would do here, if
				he got half a chance.... It's as though England
				were one's mother, and some swine were
				to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

			<p>But it's no good. I can't write about it. I'll
				try to tell you. But, do you know, it wasn't
				till I saw these fields that the notion came over
				me that I'm sort of proud and glad to have
				these blessed wounds; glad to have been knocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
				about a bit. I wonder whether you and Mother
				will be glad, too; I somehow think you will&mdash;for

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
